# Your Waifu is SHIP's opinionated & extra-biased EN Tier Guide (SUB-LIMINAL MESSAGES EDITION)

## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
Azur Lane is a special little gem of a game. In a mobile market saturated by predatory, thinly disguised gambling simulators posing as RPGs, where the only valid choice is the rarest, most expensive, most lootboxable one, Azur Lane bucks the trend by having ALL of its units entirely viable for all content, given proper gear and care.

That said, however... to quote a wise Azur Lane Community member, "just because it works, it doesn't mean it's good": while all units are indeed viable, there are clearly objectively superior ones, and this Tier Guide aims to identify who are they and for what reasons.
Indeed, you could even interpret the tiers as a relative measure of how much investment is needed to get these units to perform, if you wish - a T0 would be a beast almost right out of the gate, whereas an untiered unit would require disproportionate amounts of effort - but I'd recommend treating the tiers as they're meant to be, according to the criteria below.

Whatever the case and however you choose to read this guide, I want to stress this - ALL units are viable, SOME are better than others, NONE of them will work if you don't know how to use them.
Good reading, and godspeed cap'n!
## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
 
  
  
### Evaluation Criteria:
- Ships are tiered by their PvE PERFORMANCE first and foremost, but notes on notable PvP usage will be made if suitable.
- Ships are tiered according to their ability to act as a STAND-ALONE unit.
- Ships unable to fulfil the above criterion (eg. carriers as a whole, Vestal) are rated according to their ability to act as a SUPPORT unit; buffs/debuffs/aa/heals garner higher ranks than sheer damage output, especially during boss fights. See assorted notes for reasoning.
- Ships are compared to others in their OWN CLASS for tiering purposes; if two ships are have comparable stats and purpose, the least expensive one will be ranked higher.
- Ships in a tier are listed alphabetically and in order of nationality (USS -> HMS -> IJN -> KMS).
- All units are assumed to be MAXED (ie. lv120, BiS gear, SL10 across the board).
- Auto or Manual performance is not taken into consideration, unless it is specifically relevant to the unit.
- The Retrofit Priority List orderings are decided on the basis of how effective is the retrofitted unit, not how much does it need the retrofit; in other words, the better (more powerful/more useful) the retrofit, the higher it is.
  
  
  
#### Tier Explanations:
- Tier 0                : The best of the best, rivaled by few and matched by none. They set the bar for everyone else.
- Tier 0.5              : Terrifyingly effective units with little to no real competition in their class or function, usually by virtue of exceptionally strong skills and statlines.
- Tier 1                : Generally very effective units, albeit marred by some minor flaw that can be easily overlooked or fixed.
- Tier 1.5              : Niche, quirky or plain but solid, these units can perform their roles well but will need to be handled with care.
- Tier 2                : Very niche and/or flawed but still noteworthy, these units can nevertheless do you good but will require serious work to get them to.
- Not Tiered            : Ships that range from 'usable' to 'bottom of the barrel', but in both cases not good enough to make it on the list.
- Pro Team Players      : Ships that, while unremarkable on their own, become exceedingly good when deployed with each other. They are tiered as a single unit.
- Honourable Mentions   : Ships that, while too weak or unwieldy for general usage, nonetheless possess some interesting or useful quirk that may warrant attention.
  
  
  
#### Retrofit/Kai Priority List:
- DD                  : Laffey > Ayanami = Z23 > Cassin/Downes > Kagerou = Tanikaze > Javelin > Foxhound = Shiranui
- CL                  : Jintsuu > Leander > Ping Hai/Ning Hai > Emile Bertin > Abukuma > Curlew/Curacoa > Ajax/Achilles
- CA                  : London > Mogami > Portland > Furutaka/Kako > Suffolk
- BB/C                : Hyuuga > Ise > Yamashiro/Fusou (DO NOT TAKE LAST TWO NODES) > Nevada/Oklahoma
- CV/L                : Shouhou > Hiryu/Soryu > Ranger = Saratoga > Langley
  
  
  
#### Assorted notes:
- Read the VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE at the top.
- The 'loadout' listed under CV/L entries details the number of planes each unit gets; eg. Unicorn gets 3 Fighters / 0 Dive Bombers / 3 Torpedo Bombers.
- The 'bdmg' listed under barrage entries means "base damage", while 'coefficient' is basically a damage multiplier.
- The asterisk next to a name in the Priority List means the Kai is tied to some sort of event and may not be available right now; also, if you do not see a name in it, it's because it is not worth prioritizing.
- If you're wondering why carriers are judged differently from the rest, consider the following - they have no self-defence capabilities against suicide boats and are inherently worse than big guns at handling hard targets due to ordnance scatter and unhelpful anti-Heavy modifiers, but their AoE damage dispatches waves better than big guns usually do and come stock with screen clears.
tldr; BB/BC and CV/CVL do different things, holding them to the same standards makes little sense.
- The recommended gear automatically assumed you'll use the highest rarity available for the listed pieces of gear, unless specifying otherwise is relevant; also, DO NOT HOLD THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AS THE OPTIMAL LOADOUTS, these are meant for general or somewhat more specific purposes but they may not be the be-all end-all.  
As a guru put it,  
>"the pursuit of always optimal loadouts is a fool's errand  
(a) It is and nothing shows it better than AA, but what can ya do beyond warning and pointing out the issues with that  
yell louder that people are literally hunting for el fucking dorado"


  
  
#### Credits:
- This guide is far from a solo effort: while the writing is mine, the tierings are researched and approved collegially with Gurosebe#4054, Enbayft#2527, Cantarella#7963 and the #helpful fellows over at the Azur Lane English Community server, while the coding framework that makes this possible was provided by Enbayft#2527 and improved upon by Boz#5174; lastly, kudos to Kopfjäger for providing the original framework for the guide you're now reading.  
Without these people, the Tier Guide would never be as comprehensive, accurate or good-looking as it is, and it is to them that I extend my sincere gratitude.  
Oh, and one more thing...



#### Want to buy me a coffee?
- Curating, maintaining and researching for this Guide is something I've been doing for over a year now, ever since a few months after the first CN servers were opened to the public. It's a time-consuming endeavour, to be sure, but one I gladly do.  
If you find what I do here and/or on the Discords #helpful and would like to show me your gratitude in a slightly more tangible way, feel free to click here and buy me a coffee - thanks! (https://ko-fi.com/J3J6WRI2)

### Tier 0:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b8/LaffeyKaiChibi.png "Laffey Kai") - **[USS Laffey Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Laffey#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% activation upon firing, increases own FP, Reload, and Evasion by 40% for 8s.
  * Every 20 seconds, has a 70% chance to active Vanquish Mode, increasing own Reload stat by 200% for 10 seconds and releasing a powerful barrage.
  
* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Manual Only (ie. as you should use her)] 120mm Main Gun single; 610mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 127mm twin; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox

- Desc: Vorpal Bunny.
>While pretty good to begin with, once Kai'd Laffey truly stands out thanks to CL-tier Firepower and Efficiency coupled with absurd amounts of Reload, allowing her to akimbo gun down any fool standing in her way. Her torpedoes also come out much quicker than anyone else's, but given the lacking nature of US torps spamming them is one of the few ways to keep them relevant.  
The DPS monster to AyaKai's DPH.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b4/YukikazeChibi.png "Yukikaze") - **[IJN Yukikaze](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yukikaze)**
* Skill:
  * While alive in fleet, the backline takes -8% dmg and, once per battle, heals any backliner under 20% HP for 10% of the healed unit's max HP.
  * 25% chance to activate when taking damage, decreases said damage to 1. 
  * Her regular barrage includes 4 conventional torpedoes.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 120mm Main Gun single; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm Main Gun single or 76mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: She protecc, she attacc, but most importantly, she tsun catt.
>Nowhere as devastating as her tier companions (or a good few other IJN DDs for that matter), she is nonetheless quite powerful and has incredible defensive skills for both herself and the backline.  
Also, her barrage gets a few torps thrown into it for good measure.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/47/Z23KaiChibi.png "Z23 Kai") - **[KMS Z23 Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z23#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Firepower by 60% for 8s
  * Every 20 seconds, has a 40% (70%) chance to active Destruction Mode, releasing a powerful barrage and spawning 2 rotating shields that can block 5 enemy shells each, and for 10 seconds own main gun critical rate becomes 100%.
  * Can equip CL guns, but shouldn't.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 100mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: Gun Fuhrer.
>Z23 takes the opposite approach to Ayanami, in that she goes all in on guns - her base FP is unmatched among DDs and her skills further ehnance her gun DPS to obscene degrees, while also having great uptime.  
Torps are even more of an afterthought than they are on Laffey, however, and unlike Laffey she can't make up for it by simply spamming them; she will punch ship-sized holes in Light and Medium Armour, but she'll find herself a little stumped against Heavy.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/2b/Z46Chibi.png "Z46") - **[KMS Z46](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z46)**
* Skill:
  * Whenever enemy planes are shot down within own AA range, increase FP by 15% of own total AA stat (Only base stat and gear is counted) and if skill procs again during its duration, it refreshes the buff
  * Increases AP damage by 25%
  
* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Full AA] 100mm twin; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 113mm dual AA; Research AA Radar; Research AA Radar
  * [General Purpose] 100mm twin; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 113mm dual AA; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 100mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 113mm dual AA; Toolbox; AA Radar
  
* Desc: KMSan Diego.
>The last word in terms of DD AA and well capable of going toe-to-toe with most CL on their own field of expertise, while being vastly superior in terms of damage output, survivability, ASW prowess and - most importantly - barrage quality.  
Proud owner of a quick-firing, high-volume, AP conal barrage with four homing torpedoes to the side that is boosted both by her own +APdmg skill (do not take AP DD guns unless you hate her) and her high torp stat, she puts every other standard DD barrage in the game to shame and is the main reason for her astounding effectiveness; the AA proficiency is a nice cherry on top, but not her main draw.

### Tier 0.5:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/8b/AyanamiKaiChibi.png "Ayanami Kai") - **[IJN Ayanami Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ayanami#Retrofit)** **(T0 vs Bosses)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Torpedo by 60% for 8s
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost Evasion stat by 30% for 5s

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Manual Only (ie. as you should use her)] 120mm Main Gun single; 610mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [General Purpose] 120mm Main Gun single; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm Main Gun single or 76mm; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: Nuclear Launch Detected.
>Ayanami is the last word in Torp Damage - with her skill procced, the damage she can inflict with them is completely unrivaled and, with enough buff stacking, can even reach the tens of thousands.  
On the flip side, Torpedoes are all she's got and once she's blown her load, she won't have much to do except waiting for them to come back online; and given how massively overkill her torpedoes tend to be, it would be advisable to deploy her in boss fights first, foremost and only.  
The DPH monster to LafKai's DPS.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/84/KagerouKaiChibi.png "Kagerou Kai") - **[IJN Kagerou Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kagerou#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * Grant +15% Torpedo to the entire vanguard.
  * Upon launching a torpedo spread, 30% chance to launch a second one.
  * Every 20s, 30% chance to lower an enemy's Reload by -30% and Damage by -15% for 10s (targets humanoid ships first).

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Manual Only (ie. as you should use her)] 120mm Main Gun single; 610mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [General Purpose] 120mm twin; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: 
>Widely available early on and blessed with both excellent skills and a very solid statline, Kagerou has a place in every torp-heavy frontline (torp-CA in particular, as they typically do not have access to torpedo buffs). Her Kai is more of a slight upgrade than a massive change, with her skill being middling at best, but the extra stats are appreciated nonetheless.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/49/KawakazeChibi.png "Kawakaze") - **[IJN Kawakaze](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kawakaze)**
* Skill:
  * All IJN DD deal +15% damage to CL/CA.
  * Her torpedoes always deal 115% damage against all targets, regardless of the normal torpedo modifiers (80/100/130)

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 120mm Main Gun single; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm Main Gun single or 76mm; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: Black Not Shooter.
>A veritable turncoat of a DD, Kawakaze's main purpose is making Light Armoured units' lives hell by drilling right through it with her torps and her stellar torpedo-armed barrage - and she accomplishes it beautifully.  
Terrifyingly effective against her intended targets, to the point of overtaking even Ayanami Kai - but she does still lose to her when faced with Heavy Armour, against which her skill puts her at a disadvantage.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c3/YuudachiChibi.png "Yuudachi") - **[Poi (IJN Yuudachi)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yuudachi)**
* Skill:
  * 6% chance on Main Gun fire for +40% FP/Torp/Evasion/Reload to self.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Manual Only (ie. as you should use her)] 120mm Main Gun single; 610mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [General Purpose] 120mm Main Gun single; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm Main Gun single or 76mm; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: 
>Outclassed by 3/4 Starter Kai, but still very valid. Her superior statline, her Laffey-like generalist buff that pretty much boosts EVERYTHING worth boosting on a DD and an excellent barrage let her crank out a lot of DPS even when her torps are offline.  
The general strat is to gear her with a super-fast DD gun to proc her skill+barrage as often as possible.


### Tier 1: 
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/fd/CassinKaiChibi.png "Cassin Kai") ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/28/DownesKaiChibi.png "Downes Kai")- **[USS Cassin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Cassin#Retrofit)** **[USS Downes Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Downes#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * When HP falls under 20%, heals 25% of max HP once per battle
  * 60% chance to activate every 20 seconds, increase own Reload by 40% for 10 seconds

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox

- Desc: The bubblewrap fights back!
>Packing a lot of Firepower for destroyers and blessed with a decent Reload buff to go along the excellent self-heal, Cassin and Downes may not have the monstrous damage output of their IJN counterparts but they can and will outlast them many times over.  
As it is for Phoenix, they are best used in mobbing fleets.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/3c/NicholasKaiChibi.png "Nicholas Kai") - **[USS Nicholas Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nicholas#Retrofit)** **(T0.5 w/ Fletcher)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance upon firing to +40% her own Evasion and -40% damage received from planes for 8s
  * 60% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower for 8s
  * 70% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower/Torpedo/Reload for 10s and, once per battle, if an escort ship's Health falls below 20%, decrease the damage it takes by 15%. If the ship is Helena, additionally heal 8% of Helena's max Health

* Recommended Loadouts:

  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox

- Desc:
>Nicholas is a rarity among destroyers, in that she boasts both enough Firepower to face off with the best in her class and very solid defensive capabilities; a true generalist, even more so than Laffey considering her actually good torpedoes.  
With no real weakness on display, beyond simply not being quite as good as more specialised units, Nicholas is a worthy addition in pretty much any escort fleet - especially one with Helena or Fletcher.


![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/63/ShiranuiKaiChibi.png "Shiranui Kai") - **[IJN Shiranui Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shiranui#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 30% chance upon torpedo launch to launch a second spread
  * When alive in fleet, allied CV/L take -15% damage

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Manual Only (ie. as you should use her)] 120mm Main Gun single; 610mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox


- Desc:
>Ah, the wonders of Kai. Shiranui goes from an excellent 0LB DD meme to a supremely legit pick for normal play, owing to her much improved torp stat and efficiency. The CV/L protection skill is nice to have, too.
 
 
### Tier 1.5:

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/37/MauryChibi.png "USS Maury") - **[USS Maury](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Maury)**
* Skill:
  * 40% chance every 10s to raise evasion by 60% for 8s
  * Upon launching torpedoes, 30% chance to launch a second spread

* Recommended Loadouts:

  * [General Purpose] 136.8mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: 
>Good double torpedoes and merely okay guns? On my USS DD? It's more likely than you think.  
Maury does things differently from many of her colleagues, but she does them well - despite not quite reaching the torp heights of the IJN or the gunnery of the KMS, she strikes a comfortable balance between the two factions and proves a reliable, independent addition to most fleets.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/f3/JavelinKaiChibi.png "Javelin Kai") - **[HMS Javelin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Javelin#Retrofit)**
* Skill:

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Manual Only (ie. as you should use her)] 120mm Main Gun single; 610mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [General Purpose] 100mm twin; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 100mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: 
>While her starter version is pretty much undeniably the worst out of the three, the Kai does her some justice. Still nowhere as powerful as Ayanami or Laffey, but the EX barrage helps to close the gap while her Evasion is and remains the absolute best in the game.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/6b/FubukiChibi.png "IJN Fubuki") - **[Bucky (IJN Fubuki)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fubuki)**

* Desc: 
>The best buddy Ayanami will ever have, and she's damn good on her own too owing to her very high Evasion and Torpedo stat.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/eb/TanikazeKaiChibi.png "IJN Tanikaze Kai") - **[IJN Tanikaze Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Tanikaze#Retrofit)**

  * When only escort ship alive, increase own evasion by 10% and reduce damage taken from airstrike to self by 50%
  * When her torpedo hits an enemy, 17% chance to make said enemy take 40% more damage from all torpedoes for 8s.

* Desc:
>Tinykaze sacrifices almost every part of her statline for exceptionally powerful torpedoes and a torpedo-boosting debuff.  
Devastating if the stars align and the debuff procs on her first torp hit, but little more than a dead weight while she's stuck reloading. Handle with care.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/55/Z25Chibi.png "Z25") - **[KMS Z25](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z25)**
* Skill:
  * 60% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40% for 10s
  * Reduces the damage taken by the Flagship by 25%; can equip CL guns.
  * Can equip CL guns (but shouldn't).

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Oxytorp

* Desc: 
>Best of the three ships with the Flagship Protection skill, not only does she have powerful guns and high HP for her class but she also synergises beautifully with her intended protégé, Graf Zeppelin - who can protect her in turn.  
That said, if you have no need for such a skill you should probably look for another ship.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/4b/Z35Chibi.png "Z35") - **[KMS Z35](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z35)**

>Z35 takes a page from Laffey's book and kicks her guns into overdrive, putting them to similar effect (and wrekcing them in the process for a few seconds).  
Very similar in behaviour to her USS counterpart, but whereas she can run a one-bunny show thanks to her Kai statline and skills, Z35 needs Z1's presence to really compare; and while she won't be matching her anytime soon, she'll still be giving many other DDs a run for their money.

>Through the sheer power of chuunibyou, Z36 gets to carry extra ordnance and lob it at her enemies every 20s while buffing herself in the process.
The tempo she forces upon you is fairly demanding, as the average DD torpedo set reloads in 21-22s and that leaves you precious little time to position yourself for an attack run at full power, but if you can keep up the DPS is fairly remarkable; if you can't, however, you'll be stuck with middling efficiencies and no buff to rescue them.

Gunnery is her main asset, and her barrage even more so - one of the absolute best as far as vanguards are concerned, very quick and hard-hitting despite the unassuming Normal shells, and unique in its narrowing pattern, which makes landing most of the shots from long range a rather simple task.  
That said, you will need to deploy a few carriers to get the full experience and with her barrage making up a significant portion of her overall DPS, her auto performance will suffer - handle with care.

The AA buff is also okay, as it helps her withstand aerial punishment without into her FP as the Cleveland-class buff does; the lolibote buff isn't, as neither other loli is worth taking along and it only procs when they're around.

Her buff is the absolute best in the entire game, no exception allowed; she gets MGM+1 while keeping her torps, a rarity only six other ships have access to; and her Armour is Medium, letting her outlast a good number of her competitors.  
As amazing as all this sounds, she is let down by one glaring flaw - her abysmal offensive statline, which even her impressive buff struggles to shore up, compounded with pre-WW1-era engines that grant her the questionable honour of being the slowest ship in the game (tied with Yat Sen).  
All that said, unlike Yat Sen she is certainly usable; okay-ish on her own and an amazing force multiplier, having her around won't cut into your DPS to the point of crippling your fleet and will help your other ships MvP.

Nothing about these three looks usable, until you start deploying them together - at which point the sisters start evading better than basically anyone else in the game, even on the Single Line formation, achieveing unrivaled amounts of effective HP while dishing out respectable DPS besides.  
Lots of investment needed and Yat Sen MUST be protected at all costs (hint, place her between Ping and Ning), but they're the ultimate stonewall - if that's what you're looking for, it's worth it.

* Skill: 
  * 15% chance upon firing AA guns, +50% AA to the entire fleet.

- Desc: "The undisputed, unwanted AA queen".
>San Diego has had, for the longest time, a terrible reputation - hailed as the prime example of rarity not being an indication of quality, her reputation is somewhat deserved, considering her main claim to glory is tons of AA (to the detriment of the rest of her offensive stats) when AA is only really needed in W12, a steep Oil price tag and a tendency to appear in crafting whenever you don't want her to... but that's not all there is to it.  
The usual claim is that San Diego can't do anything to surface enemies; if you were to use her as a normal CL this would be correct, as her FP is low and her Gun Efficiency is worse. However, her barrage can dish out surprising amounts of damage and she can mount DD guns, which means she can spam said powerful barrage; moreover, while her Torpedo stat is abysmal, her Torpedo Efficiency is good enough, meaning she can benefit a lot from auxiliary torpedoes.  
Does all this redeem her, then? Not really, even in this fashion, you'd need to manually control her and you'd need lots of high-end gear to get her to perform properly. If you're not expecting planes and you don't care about her, feel free to scrap her as you always did; if you do, then Sandy might just be what you need.

- Desc:
>Second only to San Diego in terms of sheer AA prowess, she is rather similar in many regards to her pre-Kai iteration.  
Weak gunnery with access to DD guns, weak torpedoes, an AA-focused skill - the differences start with the *two* very high-efficiency AA guns she carries (deftly pushing her over Sandy base as a flyswatter), the way the AA-focused skill works (being more somewhat more reliable but also a lot more selfish) and the much weaker barrage.  
In short, she isn't tough and she isn't powerful - in fact she's really *really* wimpy - but she's an exceptionally accomplished and cheap sky clearer. Worth having around if enemy planes got you down.

- Desc: ROON FOR YOUR LIVES!
> In many ways, Saint Louis and Roon stand at opposite ends.  
Whereas the former starts out strong and loses some of her lustre as the battle drags on, the latter only gets stronger; where the former's barrage is uncomfortably wide, the latter's is very concentrated and devastating; where the former relies on high speed and evasion to stay out of harm's way, the latter simply adds layers of HP and shields to power through the barrages; and as the former gradually mellows out of her cold templar persona, the latter grows ever more violent and unhinged.  
As a result, Roon is best served on boss battles - where she has time to rev up her guns and let the concentrated barrage tear single hard targets apart.

- Desc: DESU VULT!
> Historically praised by multiple navies as one of the absolute best heavy cruiser designs but robbed of its chance to shine due to the fall of France in WW2, Azur Lane's Saint Louis has come to set the record straight - and does she ever.  
Mightiest of all CA by weight of stats and skills, there is no area where she doesn't excel - her guns absolutely melt opposing Light Armour and punch through Heavy Armour better than any other frontliners' in the game, her Speed is slightly superior to that of CLs and enjoys a hefty boost to her already high Evasion for more than half a minute after the battle starts, her AA is uncharacteristically high for her class and she enjoys all the perks of her Spe-CA peers (Medium Armour, MGM+1 and Torpedoes).  
The only fault one can find in her would be her barrage - its wide linear pattern helps dispatching multiple weak foes, yes, but also neuters its impact against single targets.

>London's retrofit is on a one-town-mission to clear the bad rap HMS CA for the most part deservedly get, and good Lord does she put in the effort.  
While her base form has never been bad, performing as well as a Leander Kai at the end of the day, her comparatively high costs and mostly irrelevant niche (buffing DD FP as well as the rest) meant she wouldn't see much use; the Kai does not change this, but it does put her DPS in the big leagues thanks to her new obscenely powerful DD mount and chance for double damage, while the stat gains make her considerably tougher beside; the +Acc stacks are nice but not particularly important as vanguards don't really struggle landing hits but more crits are appreciated nonetheless.  
Given all this, London Kai proudly joins Wichita and Choukai in their exclusive "best and most useful CA club" and does so with finesse.

- Desc: What do you mean "she's not a DD"?
> Someone at the design bureau must've missed a memo when they designed Ibuki.  
Sporting an IJN DD's skillset and an IJN CA's statline, by all rights she should be a failure on both accounts - but against all odds, she ends up taking both's best attributes and only few of the flaws.  
Her IJN DD side shines through her double preloaded torpedo spreads, the ludicrous 185% Torpedo Efficiency and entirely Torpedo-focused skills (including, if Fated, a neat +Eva buff on torpedo launch); her IJN CA side comes to the fore during the lulls inbetween torpedo strikes, as she falls back on her remarkable Torp-CA gunnery and sturdy frame to keep up the offensive.  
That said, however, she's much more of a DD than a CA - to perform at her best she needs Oxygen Torpedoes, which limit her survivability (in comparison to other CAs at least, she's still considerably tougher than most IJN DDs), as well as suitable targets, which restricts her use cases to Sirens and bosses or alternatively particularly menacing mobs.
Still, as long as you employ her for the surgical strikes she's made for, she has little to no rivals in her field.

* Desc: 
>What was said about Wichita applies to Chicago as well. Slightly frailer than she is and more selfish, she will nonetheless punch hard and harder than anyone else when she does proc, which she often will - a proc on the first salvo lasts throughout the second, and the second salvo may still proc if the first one didn't.  
As a result, her double damage uptime is considerably higher than the 30% may lead you to believe. Bring out the big guns.

- Desc: "Problem? What problem?"
>While an Evasion-focused CA sounds ludicrous, and it is under most circumstances, Houston actually makes it work given enough Evasion-boosting auxiliaries: CAs live and die by their Evasion (or lack thereof), so stacking it actually lets her survive under heavy fire for much longer than you'd expect.  
What issues she does have are fairly minor: she needs to proc to get tough, obviously, but her uptime is high and she has two chances to proc per firing cycle; and her damage output isn't as high as it could be, since her only skill is that Evasion buff, but it's still higher than most non-CA (and many Torp-CA) frontliners manage.

Capable of mounting a unique underchambered BB gun, they sport massive amounts of Firepower, a wide and severely damaging barrage and a raging hatred for anyone smaller than they (DD and CL) - but are let down by that same gun's AP element (which underperforms against DD and CL), their lower-than-average Speed and Evasion, and the weak torpedoes they're stuck with.  
A wrecking ball against small craft, to be sure, but watch out for when they pick a fight with people her size - and place Spee at the front, as she is slightly tankier than her sister.

Her direct competitor would be Portland Kai, and while she comes out of that comparison looking pretty weak (lower eHP, the extra FP comes at the expense of higher Oil costs, the lack of a barrage and the need to take at least 2+ Kizunas to outgun her), she is nonetheless a tough nut to crack and she can pack a good punch.

York Kai is one of the lucky few worthy of such lofty praise, managing to scrape by virtue of an exceptional self-buff and a Kai that gives her the sorely needed FP to make some actual use out of said skill; the second skill is an alright boost, pushing her autoguns into the realm of "kinda sorta decent" and slightly bolstering her defences, but don't be deceived by her Medium Armour and high Evasion, a tank she ain't and her abysmal luck makes sure she can't play the part for long.

    * The 4 SHELLS deal 108 bdmg with 70/100/90 mods. Their damage is modified by 100% of the unit's FP and a 110% Coefficient.
  * Enemies hit by Duke of York's Main Gun fire take +12% damage from all sources for 8s; also, her first volley deals x1.5 damage.

  * [Poverty] 406MK6; Triple 155mm Mounted Gun; 40mm Quad Bofors; Type 99 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

- Desc: 
>With stats coming close to Warspite's stellar FP and Reload and a suite of skills aimed at softening the enemy up, not only she can lay on the hurt but she can also make sure her fellow warships do the same. A worthy inclusion in every fleet.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/a/ae/MonarchChibi.png "Monarch") - **[HMS Monarch](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Monarch)**
* Skill:
  * Upon firing the Main Gun, 70% chance to launch a [barrage](http://p6.qhimg.com/t0118a6eeb421e638c2.gif); if it hits, the targets are slowed by 40% for 6s.
    * The 13 SHELLS deal 158 bdmg with 40/125/120 mods. Their damage is modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * Once per battle and upon falling below 20% HP, restore 3% HP every 2s for 8s; also, for every 1% HP lost during the fight, her Reload increases by 1.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Lategame Bossing] Twin 381mm Advanced Main Gun (general purpose) or 406MK6 (vs Light Boss); Prototype Triple 152mm Main Gun; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; SG Radar

- Desc: Hail to the Monarch, baby.
>It'd be easy to regard Monarch as a straight upgrade to Hood. She mounts CL guns, Her FP is much higher, her Efficiencies are better, her barrage is AP and she can even heal herself... what more could one possibly want from a battleship?
The truth isn't quite so simple, though. While Monarch's statline is indeed superior (with the glaring exception of AA) and the self-heal greatly extends her operational time even beyond Hood's already impressive one, Monarch's barrage will neither quicken the backline's pace nor can it be used with the same reckless abandon due to the AP modifiers; while she won't fall flat against Light Armour, courtesy of her excellent regular shelling, she doesn't quite match Hood's supportive capabilities and weight of fire.
As a result, it would be wise to pick your sovereign of choice with an eye to battlefield conditions - if enemy BB/C are out for blood or Medium/Heavy Armour is getting you down, Monarch will weather their storm and put them in their place with staggering ease.

![BC](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b4/AmagiChibi.png "IJN Amagi") - **[IJN Amagi](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Amagi)**
* Skill: 
  * -9% FP/Torp/Aviation to all enemies as long as she's alive
  * -15% Ignition dmg and +10% Evasion Rate for backline as long as she's alive
  * Upon firing the Main Gun, 70% chance to launch a [barrage](http://p6.qhimg.com/t01b63d0e2830b10cb0.gif); also, if the fleet contains 4 or more Sakura Empire ships she gains -45% cooldown on first Main Gun volley.
    * The 4 AIMED SHELLS deal 226 bdmg with 90/120/70 mods; the 6 SHELLS deal 156 bdmg with 90/120/70 mods; the 16 DD PELLETS deal 25 bdmg with 90/70/40 mods; the 4 TORPEDOES deal 124 bdmg with 80/100/130 mods. All of these's damage is modified by 100% of their relevant stats, but only the torps have a 110% Coefficient.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Lategame Bossing] Twin 381mm Advanced Main Gun; Prototype Triple 152mm Main Gun; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; SG Radar

  * [Poverty] Twin 410mm; Triple 155mm Mounted Gun; 40mm Quad Bofors; Type 99 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

- Desc: If you can't decide what to pick, pick it all.
>Packing offence debuffs for her enemies, defence buffs for her backline, a barrage that includes normal arcing shells alongside linear AP shells and even aimed torpedoes, Amagi has quite literally a bit of everything in herself; and it all comes together as one sleek and effective whole, only marginally hampered by her IJN-standard terrible AA.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/1/19/TirpitzChibi.png "KMS Tirpitz") - **[KMS Tirpitz](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Tirpitz)** **(T2 with BB/BC)**
* Skill: 
  * +30% Damage to self, as long as she is the only BB/BC in the fleet.
  * Every 15s, launches a [torpedo barrage](http://p1.qhimg.com/t01c6cc7b9a0663a9c1.gif).
    * The 4 TORPEDOES deal 137 bdmg with 80/100/130 mods. Their damage is modified by 150% of the unit's Torp stat.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 406MK6 (vs Light) or Prototype Triple 410mm Mounted Gun (vs Medium/Heavy); Prototype Triple 152mm Main Gun; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; SG Radar
  * [General Purpose] 406MK6 (vs Light) or Prototype Triple 410mm Mounted Gun (vs Medium/Heavy); Prototype Triple 152mm Main Gun; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; Super Heavy Shell
  * [Poverty] 406MK6; Triple 155mm Mounted Gun; 40mm Quad Bofors; Type 99 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

- Desc: Slow but steady...
>One of the most consistent and hardest hitting BBs in the game, provided you cater to her social anxiety.  
Unlike many of her other similarly ranked competitors, Tirpitz isn't flashy in the slightest - no 'real' barrages to speak of, no gamechanging synergies, no ability to take other BB/BC with her - but she doesn't need to be, when hitting hard as a truck with no conditions or strings attached is something none of her rivals can claim.  
Tirpitz is, in a way, the "safe" choice - her abilities can't misfire, her HP+Armour make her tougher than anyone else, her damage buff extends to both her CL guns and torpedo spread, ensuring that even at 0 Ammo she will still be able to strike and defend herself at nigh-peak efficiency regardless.  
However, all this becomes quickly irrelevant as soon as she loses her +30% damage buff as it the main reason behind her power; without it she has very little reason to be used and will be easily outshone by pretty much everyone.   

 ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/0/0f/Jean_BartChibi.png "Jean Bart") - **[MNF Jean Bart](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Jean_Bart)**
* Skill: 
  * All first Main Gun salvo deal +60% damage, and all manually aimed Main Gun salvo damage deal a further +60% damage.
  * When equipped with the 380Mle quadruple BB gun, gain +30% CritChance and +50% CritDmg on her Main Gun.
  * Starts the battle with a preloaded volley, but has MGM-1.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Lategame Bossing] 380Mle quadruple; Prototype Triple 152mm Main Gun; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; SG Radar
  * [General Purpose] 380Mle quadruple; Prototype Triple 152mm Main Gun; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; Super Heavy Shell
  * [Poverty] 380Mle quadruple; Triple 155mm Mounted Gun; 40mm Quad Bofors; Type 91 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

- Desc: The terror of the Seven Seas.
>As befitting of a pirate queen, Jean Bart doesn't play by the rules: while lacking a third salvo would be a net loss on a dreadnought's effectiveness on the field, Jean makes up for it in spades by showing up to the fight with her horrifically overcharged guns already loaded, resulting in damage spikes that would make Ayanami blush.
Volume of fire is ultimately maintained by her gun, firing a respectable 8 shots in total, and cooldowns aren't a concern either thanks to her higher-than-normal Reload; whatever she's facing, it's heading straight to Davy Jones' locker.
Absolutely devastating, and unlike Tirpitz she has no compunctions about fellow dreadnoughts. The Jolliest Roger of them all.

 
### Tier 0.5:

![BC](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/5f/HoodChibi.png "HMS Hood") - **[HMS Hood](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hood)** **(T0 in Plane Hells)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon firing the Main Gun, 70% chance to launch a [barrage](http://p8.qhimg.com/t01c83095ed25b82e28.gif) and grant +40% Reload to the entire backline.
    * The 13 SHELLS deal 174 bdmg with 70/100/90 mods. Their damage is modified by 100% of the unit's FP.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Lategame Bossing] Twin 381mm Advanced Main Gun; QF 120mm Twin; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; SG Radar
  * [General Purpose] Twin 381mm Advanced Main Gun; QF 120mm Twin; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; Super Heavy Shell
  * [Poverty] Twin 410mm; QF 120mm Twin; 40mm Quad Bofors; Type 91 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

- Desc: More than just a sub.
>Second only to Tirpitz in terms of pure staying power and armed with a quickly-proccable, backline-buffing, devastating barrage, she is exceptionally good under almost all circumstances; whether it is tearing apart mob nodes, showering enemy battleships in heavy firepower or providing support, Hood gets it done.  
Remember to have her be the flagship to make the most out of her barrage, and that the lower the cooldown on her main gun, the better.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e0/HyuugaChibi.png "IJN Hyuuga") - **[IJN Hyuuga](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hyuuga)**

  * [General Purpose] 406MK6 (vs Light) or Prototype Triple 410mm Mounted Gun (vs Medium/Heavy); Prototype Triple 152mm Main Gun; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; Super Heavy Shell
  * [Poverty] 406MK6; Triple 155mm Mounted Gun; 40mm Quad Bofors; Type 91 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

* Desc: 
>THE cost-effective BB in the game, bar none. No other battleship can boast a Firepower as high as hers, nor can they buff their colleagues' Firepower while they're at it - and Hyuuga does all this at the low, low price of 13 Oil.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/85/NagatoChibi.png "Nagato") - **[IJN Nagato](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nagato)** **(T0 w/ IJN CV/L)**
* Skill: 
  * When sortied as Flagship, grant all IJN units +10% Firepower, +20% Reload/Accuracy, and +20% damage output to all IJN carriers.
  * Upon firing the Main Gun, 40% chance to launch a [barrage](http://p4.qhimg.com/t012fd5d78db44ba7d1.gif).
    * The 16 SHELLS deal 125bdmg with 90/120/70 mods; the 44 NEEDLES deal 125bdmg with 120/100/80 mods. The damage of both is modified by 100% of the unit's FP.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Lategame Bossing] Prototype Triple 381mm AA Gun (vs Light) or Prototype Triple 410mm Mounted Gun (vs Medium/Heavy); Prototype Triple 152mm Main Gun; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; SG Radar

  * [Poverty] 406MK6; Triple 155mm Mounted Gun; 40mm Quad Bofors; Type 91 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

* Desc: Mikasa for those who don't like or want more big guns.
>A well-rounded warship on her own right compared to her dakka-centric senpai, her set of buffs is about as good as those provided by Mikasa but she needs the flagship slot even more due to her barrage.
Place her there and she'll carry your IJN carrier division to glory and triumph; place her to the sides and she's merely okay.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/2c/BismarckChibi.png "Bismarck") - **[KMS Bismarck](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Bismarck)** **(T0 w/ KMS units around)**
* Skill: 
  * The first salvo of her every volley always crits; also extends the range of any CL gun equipped to 90 units (= white line that pushes you back when approached), but reduces their damage by 35%.
  * If flagship, 70% chance to fire a weak barrage (4 shots to the centre of the screen, 2 shots to each side, some mid-ranged DD pellets in the middle); also, passively raise KMS carrier damage by 20%.
    * The 8 SHELLS deal 110 bdmg with 70/100/90 mods; the 14 DD PELLETS deal 20 bdmg with 120/60/60 mods. The damage of both is modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * Grant +20% CritRate to the guns/torpedoes/planes used by KMS units, grant +12% Reload to all KMS units, grant Tirpitz +40% Damage.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Lategame Bossing] 406MK6 (vs Light) or Prototype Triple 410mm Mounted Gun (vs Medium/Heavy); Twin 150mm Tbtsk; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; SG Radar
  * [General Purpose] 406MK6 (vs Light) or Prototype Triple 410mm Mounted Gun (vs Medium/Heavy); Twin 150mm Tbtsk; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; Super Heavy Shell
  * [Poverty] 406MK6; Triple 155mm Mounted Gun; Twin 150mm Tbtsk; Type 99 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

* Desc: Here comes Tutorial Girl!
>At long last the wehraboos can rejoice - Bismarck has arrived, and she's every bit as good as they'd hoped.  
Positively brimming in buffs for herself as well as her countrywomen, her sole presence is enough to kick all their weaponry into overdrive, having them shoot harder and slightly faster, while their carriers (all one/two of them) enjoy a massive Nagato-like damage injection and Tirpitz finally overcomes her social anxiety with oneesan around.
Her own guns are no strangers to buffs either, with guaranteed crits on every first salvo of every volley and massively extended CL secondary ranges (at the cost of 1/3 less damage); the former buff easily steals the spotlight, but the range extension allows her to lend a hand to a vanguard that's in over its head (or take potshots at vanguards in PvP).  
Last and least, she has a barrage too. It's not particularly good, but it's there and no other KMS backliner has a better one, so have her be the flag.  

### Tier 1:

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/1/10/ArizonaChibi.png "USS Arizona") - **[USS Arizona](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Arizona)**

  * [Poverty] Twin 410mm; 128SKC; 40mm Quad Bofors; Type 91 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

- Desc: WAIT DON'T LEAVE JUST YET. 
>Healing on a cointoss sounds pretty bad, yes, but ask yourself this - how many units can properly heal at all, and how many of them pack the Firepower, sturdiness and self-defence capabilities of a BB?
>Yup, that's just her - and while her heal isn't as reliable as that of Unicorn or Shouhou, she's an excellent fit for a vanguard who doesn't strictly need the heals to stay alive and keep fighting.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/cd/North_CarolinaChibi.png "USS North Carolina") - **[USS North Carolina](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/North_Carolina)** **(T0 in Plane Hells)**
* Skill:
  * -15% incoming aviation damage to the backline as long as North Carolina is alive and in the fleet
  * Increase FP by 30% of her total AA stat (buffs not included)

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Lategame Bossing] 406MK6 (vs Light) or Prototype Triple 410mm Mounted Gun (vs Medium/Heavy); 128SKC; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Research AA Radar; SG Radar

  * [Poverty] 406MK6; 128SKC; 40mm Quad Bofors; Type 99 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

- Desc: 
>Anti-air for backliners is a bit of a meme, but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one.  
North Carolina goes harder than anyone else on the AA front, as far as backliners are concerned - not only does she prevent plane damage with her skill, she also grows stronger the more AA she acquires (and she's plenty strong to begin with, sporting a very high base FP thanks to said skill).  
Whether you do actually need all that AA is another matter entirely, but rest assured that she will lay on the hurt even if you don't - and if you do, that's just gravy.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/2f/Kaga_%28Battleship%29Chibi.png "IJN Kaga BB") - **[IJN Kaga (BB)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kaga_(Battleship))**
* Skill:
  * Upon firing the Main Gun, 50% chance to launch a [barrage](http://p8.qhimg.com/t01d5fb2bae251530e2.gif).
     * The 10 SHELLS deal 195bdmg with 70/100/90 mods; the 20 DD PELLETS deal 35bdmg with 120/60/60 mods; the 8 TORPEDOES deal 96bdmg with 80/100/130 mods. All of these's damage is modified by 100% of their respective stats and a 110% Coefficient.
  * 10s after battle start and every 20s, afterwards, launches a torpedo barrage (2 lines of 2 aimed torps).
  * Akagi counts her as Kaga, thus proccing her +Aviation buff.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Lategame Bossing] Prototype Triple 381mm AA Gun (vs Light) or Prototype Triple 410mm Mounted Gun (vs Medium/Heavy); Prototype Triple 152mm Main Gun; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; SG Radar

  * [Poverty] 406MK6; Triple 155mm Mounted Gun; 40mm Quad Bofors; Type 91 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

- Desc: A sidegrade to Washington.
>Sturdier, more powerful, better armed and in possession of a much more useful synergy (Akagi still gets her +35% Aviation buff with her) in PvE, BB Kaga - affectionately called "Baga" - does however forfeit some reliability on her enhanced barrage and is stuck with an atrocious AA stat.  
She also has a few torps to throw out every now and then, but they're fairly lacklustre.

* Desc: 
>The second most cost-effective BBs in the game, owing to their remarkable statline, Kai nodes and comparatively low Oil costs.  
Their Kai is unique in that it is a sidegrade rather than an upgrade: when turned into BBV, they trade their CL guns and 1/3 of their BB salvo for seaplanes, letting them launch airstrikes as if they were carriers.  
A steep price to pay, especially considering how weak the seaplanes are in comparison to 'proper' bombers, how slow the launches are in comparison to 'proper' carriers and how much better are Ise and Hyuuga as BBVs.

- Desc: An upgrade to Washington.
>Though she may not look much like the part, BB AI does live up to her title; between the very significant crit boost (for which the +1 scatter may as well not be there, insubstantial as it is), the hilariously scattershot but poweful barrage clearing the field for the Main Guns and access to CL defensive guns, there's very little not to like here.  
The Accuracy and Evasion boosts are nice to have, too, but not exactly worthy of prime time - especially as the +Acc ends up compensating for her lower-than-usual base stat.

  * Main Gun ammo is overrideen to SHS (60/135/115, shells fire at extremely high angles and fall from the sky) and salvo damage increases the farther the shots land, up to +30% dmg.

* Desc: Massachusetts shoots for the stars, but the aim isn't quite there. 
>On paper she'd easily be T1 material, as the self-buffs are both significant and easily achieved while the SHS ammo type and its enhanced AP modifiers allow her to damage Light Armour... but it also severely reduces both the splash radius of the shots AND their scatter, piledriving her chances to hit even slowly moving targets into the ground.
If you can guarantee your target won't be moving around much at all and is bigger than a CL, a very solid pick; if you can't, best look elsewhere.

While KGV is yet another sovereign who doesn't buff back her fellow countrywomen, there's no denying the buff she receives from them is both quite simple to attain (the HMS is spoiled for good backline choices) and substantial; not only that, her damage buff is hardly ever out of a job considering 99% of the enemies in PvE are IJN.  
As for the 356mm, long story short - it only overtakes the good ol' 406MK6 if her first volley lands most of its shots and hits something valuable, otherwise the long cooldown and the subpar damage eventually catch up to her; it won't cripple her but she won't benefit a whole lot from it either, and her barrage is fairly anaemic anyway so buffing it isn't too desirable a prospect.  
In short, she's a big burly beatstick that'll benefit from having some HMS cheerleaders around. Only let her be the flag if nobody else has a better barrage.

As awful in AL as she is in WoWS, Izumo is bad by any standard - her barrage barely scratches Light Armour while being unable to bypass it due to the parallel shots, her 'defensive' skill harms her much more than it does protect her due to the complete absence of enemy BB AP (and prevalence of BB HE), and worse still, as a barrage boat she needs flagship slot... while sharing Mikasa and Nagato's nation.
Her sole saving grace is her exceptional statline, and even then it is marred by high Oil costs, comparatively low Efficiencies and is far from making any significant difference.
Bad not just by PR standards but as a whole, there is little to no reason to ever use her over any other barrage boat.

- Desc: "The poor man's Barrage Boat."
>A description partly in jest, and partly absolutely accurate - compared to a normal BB, they are incredibly frail (barely 3k HP with Light Armour) and considerably weaker (low FP, slightly lower Efficiency, one less salvo per volley), but they also cost a fraction than what they do and still get truly impressive barrages.  
How does this come together? As pint-sized discount-costed powerhouses for early world farming, that's how: while low, their Firepower is enough to stop fireboats in their tracks, and if given enough Evasion, they can be reliably expected to evade incoming BB salvo, prolonging their operational time much beyond what their abysmal statline would lead you to believe.  
Monitors can be expected to auto their way up to W8 or 9 with little resistance. Any further, though, and auto becomes almost impossible as enemies get more accurate, tougher and more powerful: the moment a BB opens up on them, they're already dead.

  * Upon firing the Main Gun, 40% chance to launch a [barrage](http://p7.qhimg.com/t01f60ecc8d39dd90a8.gif).
    * The 44 NEEDLES deal 156 bdmg with 100/80/70 mods. Their damage is modified by 100% of the unit's FP.

- Desc: "Newbie traps."
>So you just started playing and found these two BBs. Their barrages fire lasers everywhere and melt mobs and they look pretty tough, so they've gotta be good, right?  
Well, no, not really. It'll be like that only early on, where enemies tend to fall to a stiff breeze anyway, but the moment they're faced by serious opposition and normal (eg. 1.5k / 2k HP per trash mob) HP pools, the weaknesses of said barrage quickly come to the fore: low proc rate, proc fixed to main gun fire (which means having to take faster and weaker guns to fish for said procs), super-wide pattern subject to massive scatter and unable to hit what's directly in front of them, poor armour modifiers and poor base damage.  
In short, their barrage is the only notable feature they have - and it's both unreliable and weak.  
Avoid.

  * (Maryland) When her HP drops below 70% increase her damage dealt based on how low her HP is, up to +35%.

- Desc: "The pits."
>You know what was just said about Nelson and Rodney? Well, they're even worse, courtesy of their weaker statlines and lack of CL guns; as for Maryland's +Dmg on low HP, it goes without saying that if you're taking damage, you're in an undesirable situation to begin with.  
Outgunned, outskilled, outcosted. With no hyperbole, they ARE the worst BBs in the game.

  * Grant +15% FP to the backline.
  * Gain +20% FP.
  * 10s after battle start, 10s cooldown after each use and used only when an enemy gets too close, fire 4 converging CA shells.
 
* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Lategame Bossing] 406MK6 (vs Light) or Prototype Triple 410mm Mounted Gun (vs Medium/Heavy); Zuiun; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; SG Radar

* Desc: 
>The only aviation battleship to improve in every possible respect after her Kai, the new-and-improved Hyuuga doesn't only sport the customary brutal firepower and enough Main Gun Efficiency to thorougly brutalize what she hits despite the loss of one gun mount, but also retains good self-defence capabilities with her protective barrage.   
The seaplanes are still middling at best, but you're paying no price for a BB with access to a screenclear - that's more than good enough.


 ### Tier 0.5:

   ![BBV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/26/IseKaiChibi.png "Ise Kai") - **[IJN Ise Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ise#Retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * Gain +20% FP.
  * Ise Kai's first two airstrikes have their cooldown reduced by 25% and launch 2 Suisei dive bombers; if a CV/L is present in the fleet, these bonuses remain active.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Lategame Bossing] 406MK6 (vs Light) or Prototype Triple 410mm Mounted Gun (vs Medium/Heavy); Zuiun; Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG; Type 1 Shell; SG Radar

  * [Poverty] 406MK6; Zuiun; 40mm Quad Bofors; Type 99 Shell; Autoloader (mobs) or SG Radar (boss)

* Desc: 
>Still the more powerful yet less useful sibling, Ise Kai fully embraces her nature as an instrument of destruction by improving her airstrikes to the point of respectability.
Damage's still not on par with proper carriers, sure, but it's leagues better than what other BBVs gets in terms of both damage and cooldown - and the only thing better than a screenclear is a screenclear that can take out some enemies alongside the bullets.

 ### (Dis)honourable Mentions:

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/9a/YamashiroKaiChibi.png "Yamashiro Kai") ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/0/05/FusouKaiChibi.png "Fusou Kai") - **[IJN Yamashiro Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yamashiro#retrofit)** **[IJN Fusou Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fusou#retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * +20% FP to self.
  * On first airstrike, launch additional Zuiun.

* Desc: 
>So this was already mentioned in the BB section, but to reiterate - Yamashiro and Fusou really get the short end of the stick here.  
Their gains in term of Firepower and Efficiency are not only insufficient to properly compensate for the MGM-1 (loss of 1/3 salvo), they're vastly outgunned by their superior BBV brethren; and their special BBV skill is a Zuiun airstrike that falls well short of even weak CVL airstrikes.  
In short, they're by all accounts a downgrade over their BB forms. Avoid like the plague.

* Desc: Centaur is the best generalist the game has to offer among its backliners.
>Aircraft got you down? Here's 4 Figthers, backed up by high Airpower and good efficiencies.  
Need to squeeze out some more damage? Her Swordfishes and 'conventional' torp bombers are pretty brutal.  
Backline could use some buffs or packing BBV? Whether it's carriers or battleships OR BOTH, she's got them (and herself) covered.  
Enemy ships are zipping around too much for your liking? Her Swordfishes inflict Slow and throw out two walls of crisscrossing torps, so they can have fun with that.  
Subs? Don't let her stats fool you, she's still a CVL and that means she can bomb them with impunity (and great effect at that).  
Whatever's getting you down, Centaur has the solution for it - and while she won't match the heights of more specalized units in their fields, her responses tend to be more than enough for most tasks at hand.

>The best solo CV currently in the game, courtesy of her generally superior statline and a skill that can reliably lay the smackdown on waves and airwings alike - as well as provide some emergency damage absorption against incoming aircraft or shelling.  
It's not all bombs and sunshine, though - while her proc rate is high, she is nevertheless very reliant on that proc to perform and her generalist Efficiencies tend to blunt her effectiveness somewhat.

>Also referred to as RNGer for obvious reasons, and infamous because of her potentially infinite damage, you need luck on your side to get the most out of her; even without the procs, though, very few carriers get close to the sheer damage output she can unleash thanks to her 8 sea-attacking planes and high Efficiencies, and none of them can manage it at her rock-bottom 9 Oil cost.  
Beware her near-total lack of anti-air presence, though; without Fighters or AA guns to speak of, there's little she can do about enemy planes.

>Well, there they are, the poster vixens of Azur Lane. Distintctive in both looks and performance, they dwarf literally every other Carrier in the game with their massive amounts of Airpower and get to launch faster than anyone else, guaranteeing swift victories in PvP and one and a half extra airstrike per battle compared to almost any other carrier.  
As is customary for IJN sister ships, they truly shine when used together - but even when taken on their own, it cannot be understated how valuable that early launch (and extra screenclear) is.

>Saratoga's Kai doesn't significantly change her playstyle: she's still the powerful DB-focused CV she's always been, but with a considerably improved statline that further emphasises her strengths. Extremely solid, even from a HP standpoint.  
Her Kai skill, just like her gunfire skill, is best regarded as a bit of free additional damage than a reliable contribution to the fight - the extra planes have aimed torpedoes and the DoTs they inflict are fairly weak, but it's still better than most CV do in their downtime.

Her only real flaw is her lacking Reload, a mere 100 compared to most other top-of-the-line carriers - and, of course, her lack of synergy with non-KMS units, so keep her in there and she'll do work.

Just don't expect much in the way of support, beyond the air coverage provided by her okay fighters.

>Chaser had a look at Ranger before leaving for the Royals and realised she was up to something good.  
With functionally 9 planes at her back and call without giving up her AA guns or high Reload, she can handily rival most other CVL in DPS while keeping some support capabilites to her credit - as well as a decent chance to throw out torrents of planes.  
That said, she's still mostly an attack craft - her ASW capabilties, while a nice touch, are entirely useless on non-ASW maps and unnecessary there, given how easily dealt with subs are.

>An extra-tough carrier designed for prolonged fights, which basically means 'boss battles only'.  
Her skill barely contributes to most battles, and without her sister ship she's missing out a fair chunk of the stats that let her ramp up be as effective as it can be.

  * Has a 3/3/0 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Similar in concept and usage to Ranger, her airstrikes come out faster but don't provide close to the same weight of fire.  
Still, high plane efficiency coupled with a neat AA buff for the backline allows her to be decently useful and cost-effective in most situations.

>The cheapest CV in the game, by virtue of her Blue rarity... and that's pretty much it, as far as remarkable features go.  
Her staline is somewhat lacklustre, her skill doesn't add much to her DPS and pushes you into using HMS backliners.  
While definitely usable, her only real use case would be plugging Hard Mode enforced ship requirements.

* Desc: 
>Smol Akagi is an interesting little thing, with those invincibility-granting airstrikes of hers - but lacking a real purpose in an environment crowded with excellent IJN DPS carriers, not least of which Akagi proper (against which her barrage really can't stack up), and a better vanguard protection in the form of Illustrious' bubble.
However, invincibility *can* go where no bubble has gone before in EX maps...

>The first carrier to ever sail the seas, and it shows. As THE early prototype for the ships that would later dominate the oceans, she's incredibly weak and brought further down by her mandatory CL gun - which can barely deal scratch damage, owing to her 0 Firepower statline.  
Why is she even mentioned, then? Because her +XP skill stacks with Langley's, that's why, and having her around as a 0LB exp booster may be a good idea to hasten the leveling process.

  * Gain +5% AA, Aviation and Reload for every KMS unit in the fleet.
  * Has a 3/3*/0 loadout; her 3rd slot may be filled with a Dive Bomber (launches two planes) or a CL gun (fires twice).

* Desc: 
>The one and only carrier fully capable of defending herself, and actually contributing somewhat to the fight through her barrage.  
A remarkable claim to fame for her class, but somewhat let down by her poor efficiencies and poor offensive statline; fielding her in a KMS fleet is all but necessary to have her compete in battle effectiveness with light carriers.  
She *does* keep Tirpitz happy, though.

### A few preliminary notes

"Submarines" are powerful but specialized tools that behave rather differently from your ordinary fleets.
Here's a quick rundown of how they work.

1. You cannot control them directly; they will spawn in one of several fixed locations on every map and will stay there until you give them the command to relocate elsewhere (which costs a tiny amount of oil, roughly 1 + sub amount + tiles to move).
2. Submarine fleets move 2 tiles per turn, ignoring geography, and shave off up to 20% max HP (more with submarine-boosting meowfficers) off of ALL enemies in the node, and may also be summoned in battle if your regular fleets are fighting within said range. Map strike damage depends on the sub fleet's overall Power Rating, in-battle damage depends on the usual mechanics.
3. Submarine fleets in battle act as a sort of tactical nuke button; when summoned they will join the fight in person and unleash inordinate amounts of torpedoes via barrages to brutalize everything unfortunate enough to be on screen at the time, then stay for roughly 20s (exact amount depends on their Oxygen stat, with 10 Oxy equaling 1s) firing their 'regular' torpedoes until they run out of O2 and have to surface.
4. Unless in possession of skills saying otherwise, every sub carries 2 Ammo with her; this ammo is expended for Map Strikes and Call-Ins, and unlike normal fleets, once they're out of ammo they're completely out of the fight.
5. Submarine statlines are generally very similar to one another, barring a few exceptions; as it is with BBs and BCs, skills are the main discriminant here.
6. Gear is very important in order to have them perform properly. Do your damn SOS missions, fellas.

Given these premises, it quickly becomes apparent that **submarine fleets are meant to be fielded as a trio**; whether it be mauling nodes on the map or providing heavy torpedo support, they only reach peak efficiency as a full fleet, and in the case of map strikes such efficiency comes at no oil cost whatsoever.
As such, this section *does not contain tiers* but specific recommendations and groupings - let's get to them.

* Skill (U-73): 
  * Deal +15% Damage to CV/L.
  * Gain +6% Torp/Reload per KMS submarine in the fleet.
  
* Skill (U-81): 
  * Deal +20% Damage to CV; also, U-81's torps have a 15% chance to inflict Flooding (DoT similar to Ignition; 3s ticks, multiple procs do not stack but refresh duration) for 24s.
  * Gain +40% Evasion; also, gain +7% Torp/Reload/Acc for every KMS sub in the fleet.
  
* Skill (U-101):
  * Gain +15% Accuracy; if *not* sortied as flagship U-101 moves roughly into facetorp range and hovers around there for 18s, falling back afterwards.
  * Grant +7% EvaRate and +7% Damage vs DD/CL to all KMS submarines in the fleet; gain +6% Torp/Reload for every KMS submarine in the fleet.
  
* Skill (U-522)
  * Gain +20 O2; also, once per sortie, the sub fleet can be called in regardless of its position on the map.
  * Gain +6% Torp/Reload per KMS submarine in the fleet.
  
* Skill (U-556)
  * Whenever an allied unit falls below 20% HP, launches a torpedo barrage; if Bismarck is in the fleet, the barrage improves.
  * Gain +6% Torp/Reload per KMS submarine in the fleet.

* Desc: Achtung - U-Boot!
>Given real world Germany's history with submarines, it comes as no surprise that the Ironblood gets the apex specimens of their class.  
Highly synergistic, they all benefit from hanging out with each other but are frail and somewhat lacking in support options otherwise - murdering stuff in call-ins is what they do best and that's all they do, but they better not take casualties.  
*About U-81...* she torpedoes harder and gains more than the others from having fellow countrychildren around.  
*About U-101...* being able to close the distance with the enemy drastically lowers the chance to physically miss the target, but it is also somewhat suicidal if she's not equipped with a Snorkel. What's that? Not in EN? How unfortunate.  
*About U-522...* the call-in from across the map is a bit of a meme since you can move your fleet around anyway, but the extra O2 is just enough to let her skip Snorkels in favour of another Oxytorp.  
*About U-556...* yes, having someone reach critical HP is a terrible condition, and now she's not the only option for a full KMS fleet anymore she's the worst sub in the game. Sorry.  
*About all of them...* their barrages are semi-homing, just like regular acoustic torps. Have fun.

* Skill (I-19): 
  * 8s after joining the battle, launches a wave of penetrating torpedoes (up to 2 pierces, similarly to AP shells).
  * I-19's torpedoes lose 1 Speed and deal +12% Damage.
  
* Skill (I-56): 
  * If the Airspace Control status isn't Air Denial or Air Incapability, gain +15% FP/Torp/Reload.
  * I-56's torpedoes lose 1 Speed and deal +12% Damage.
  
* Skill (I-168): 
  * Deal +20% Damage to CV; also, launch a special torpedo barrage with 100% CritRate upon surfacing.
  * I-168's torpedoes lose 1 Speed and deal +12% Damage.
  
* Desc: Large and Discharge.
>Much larger and better supplied than their KMS counterparts, this line of IJN attack submarines trade synergy for heavy duty torpedoes, torpedo barrages and somewhat thicker hulls.  
*About I-56...* notice how it only says "AC Denial/Incapability"? Yes, this does mean she still procs in EN, where there is no Airspace Control at all.
*About all of them...* don't mind the slower torpedoes, it's actually a benefit rather than a detriment! Fast torpedoes may well zip past the intended target if it moved, but slow ones have a good chance to strike that target on the way back.

  * Deal +15% Damage to CV.
  * Gain +40 Oxygen.

* Skill (I-58):

* Desc: O2 Jamming.
>A rather diverse bunch of girls, these ones, but they all share a trait - their Oxygen tanks are ample enough to accommodate for two full Mark 16 torpedo volleys, which means they can safely be ran with dual Oxygen Torpedoes.  
About I-58... she currently is the best one of the bunch, as she gets a special barrage to go along the extra O2.

* Skill: 
  * Upon joining the battle, launch a Type 0 Seaplane armed with a single bomb and grant +10% Accuracy to all subs in the fleet.
  * Upon surfacing, launch a torpedo barrage; also, her gunfire and barrage torpedoes have a 70% chance to lower the Reload/Acc of the enemies struck by 10%.

* Desc:
>A heavy-duty support submarine, I-25 forgoes the damage boosts many others have in favour of buffs and debuffs.  
While you shouldn't expect anything much out of the seaplane bomb, the +Acc buff is both permanent and rather substantial; the debuff, less so, but it is still welcome.  


#### ![SS](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e8/SurcoufChibi.png "Surcouf") - [FFNF Surcouf](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Surcouf)
* Skill: 
  * Upon joining the battle, grant +20% Accuracy to the vanguard.
  * Upon surfacing, fire her barrage and stay on the field for 12s longer.
  * Mounts a unique CA gun instead of the regular DD guns. It's good.

* Desc: On v ya!
>Surcouf is unique among subs for several reasons, not least of which her ability to stand her ground while surfaced.
Firstly, her guns are not only actually useful but also threatening; secondly, she bolsters the vanguard's fighting prowess with a hefty Accuracy buff; thirdly, she stays on the field for longer than anyone else while making full use of her entire armament throughout it all.
Her one downside is a subpar hunting range, but she's not meant to stay front and centre anyway.

### A few notes, and Vestal

"Repair Ship" is a misnomer for these crafts, to say the least. Here are the reasons why ---> https://pastebin.com/RucY4TwC  
TLDR; they contribute little to nothing to the fight, their healing is pathetic and vastly outclassed as soon as you use more than a single DD for your vanguard, the +1 ammo is easily negated by a single ambush (and given the inability to attack surface targets they can't assist the fleet in the battle either) and they cost the same as the much superior healer options (Unicorn / Shouhou / Arizona).  
However, **Vestal** - unlike Akashi - has a few redeeming features that make her worth taking along for lategame low(ish)-cost farming, provided you don't mind the increase in clearing times.

#### ![AR](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/3c/VestalChibi.png "USS Vestal") - [USS Vestal](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Vestal)
* Skill: 
  * Once per battle, Vestal heals a ship under 20% HP by 20% of the healed's HP; if the target is Enterprise, the healing amount is increased by 50%.
  * Begin each Sortie with 3 Emergency Repairs (consumable +10% fleetwide HP heals, used in the map screen). 
 
* Desc: "Vestal is Bestal".  
>"Wait, Vestal? Why not Akashi? Isn't her heal better?", you may be asking yourself - and you'd be right, Akashi's healing capacity is technically better. And it doesn't matter in the slightest.  
As covered above, Repair Ships are *terrible* healers and far outshone by cheaper/stronger/both options; competing with them is a lost cause.  
What you seek in a Repair Ship is utility, and Vestal brings a surprising amount of it to the table: be it through her rescue skill, guaranteed to save an ailing backliner's sorry arse, her stellar AA suite (two AA gun slots, each benefiting from the ARs' inbuilt +1 AGM, and three auxiliary slots you can fill with AA radars to kick her plane offence into high gear), and the usual 3 fleetwide consumable heals.  
She won't clear quick and she's obviously more suited to high-AA environments, but she *will* get the job done.
