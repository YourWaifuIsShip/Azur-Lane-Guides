# Your Waifu is SHIP's opinionated & extra-biased Unit Guide (IDOLMASTER EDITION)

## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
Be it because of the very generous gacha, dinctly not predatory monetisation, the shoot-em-up RPG gameplay or the ever-increasing unit roster, Azur Lane stands out among oceans of mobage for several reasons; the most relevant of which, in my opinion, is fostering a Pokémon-esque approach to compbuilding, where the player is encouraged and/or expected to use the units they like the most, rather than simply homing into the 'strongest' ones.  
While a very laudable approach, it is also one that lends itself to misconceptions of the toxic casual "ez gaem lmao use w/e ur gud" variety: to quote a wise Azur Lane Community member, "just because it works, it doesn't mean it's good": while all units are indeed viable, there are clearly objectively superior ones, and this Tierless Guide aims to identify who are they and for what reasons.  
A few years at this and counting, and it's become to me abundantly clear that tiers cause a lot more issues than they actually solve; most people only pay attention to the tier and ignore the reasons why they're tiered that way, engage in pointless debates over which tier is *right* (like it's not all subjective anyway) and are left knowing just as much as they did before about the unit itself or how they are supposed to use it. 
The Tierless Guide means to dispense with all that nonsense and tell you all the important stuff, with none of the nastiness and drivel that inevitably follows tiers. Should you still wish for a shorter form writeup on what the units are like, [consider checking the Ko-Fi posts here.](https://ko-fi.com/ywisguides#).  
Whatever the case and however you choose to read this guide, I want to stress this - ALL units are viable, SOME are better than others, NONE of them will work if you don't know how to use them.
Good reading, and godspeed cap'n!
## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
 
  
  
### Evaluation Criteria:
- Ships are evaluated by their PvE PERFORMANCE first and foremost, but notes on notable PvP usage will be made if suitable.
- Ships are evaluated according to their ability to act as a STAND-ALONE unit.
- Ships unable to evaluated the above criterion (eg. carriers as a whole, Vestal) are rated according to their ability to act as a SUPPORT unit; buffs/debuffs/aa/heals garner higher ranks than sheer damage output, especially during boss fights. See assorted notes for reasoning.
- Ships are compared to others in their OWN CLASS for tiering purposes; if two ships are have comparable stats and purpose, the least expensive one will be ranked higher.
- Ships are listed alphabetically and in order of nationality (USS -> HMS -> IJN -> KMS -> France -> Italy -> Russia).
- All units are assumed to be MAXED (ie. lv120, BiS gear, SL10 across the board). PRs are an exception, as they take at the very least two full months to max, let alone rainbow ones.
- Auto or Manual performance is not taken into consideration, unless it is specifically relevant to the unit.
- The Retrofit Priority List orderings are decided on the basis of how effective is the retrofitted unit, not how much does it need the retrofit; in other words, the better (more powerful/more useful) the retrofit, the higher it is.
  
  
  
#### Role Explanations:
- The Role field seeks to explain at a glance what's the purpose of a unit, how it should be employed, and how does it compare in those roles to other units in her hull class. A **bold** role means that should be the unit's main purpose; an absent role means the unit cannot be relied upon to perform said role at all.
- DPS can be Gun, Torp, Plane or Barrage focused, and can be Light / Below Average / Medium / Above Average / Heavy / Extreme.
- Tank can be Light / Medium / Heavy.
- AA can be either Carry (will spearhead the fleet's AA damage) or Support (will assist significatively to the fleet's AA damage but should not be expected to handle things on its own), with both having Light / Medium / Heavy variants.
- Support is too varied a field and thus simply references how the unit supports others via heals, buffs or debuffs.
- If you'd like to know individual numbers, feel free to ask me on Discord (or Issues if you truly must).

#### Retrofit/Kai Priority List and PRiority list:
- DD                  : Ayanami = Z23 > Laffey > Kagerou = Tanikaze = Z1 > Nicholas = Cassin/Downes > Javelin > Foxhound = Shiranui
- CL                  : San Diego* > Jintsuu > Leipzig = Leander > Kinu = Emile Bertin > Helena > Curlew/Curacoa > Abukuma = Ping Hai/Ning Hai (ONLY WITH YAT SEN) > Ajax/Achilles
- CA                  : London > Mogami > Portland > Furutaka/Kako > Suffolk > Exeter
- BB/C                : Hyuuga > Warspite* > Ise > Yamashiro/Fusou (DO NOT TAKE LAST TWO NODES) = Nevada/Oklahoma
- CV/L                : Hiryu/Soryu > Shouhou > Langley > Ranger = Saratoga
 
 - PR1                : Monarch > Ibuki > Saint Louis > Neptune > Roon (unless focusing on KMS) 
 - PR2                : Georgia > Kitakaze = Gascogne > Seattle > Azuma > Friedrich der Grobe (unless focusing on KMS)
 - PR3                : Odin = Champagne > Cheshire > Mainz > Drake

#### Assorted notes:
- Read the VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE at the top.
- Gear isn't an afterthought; good units with bad gear fail where bad units with good gear succeed. Learn what's good and why [here](https://github.com/Meowrin/al-guides), and if you don't know the nicknames for the various pieces of gear, look [here](https://imgur.com/a/4wEvTQo).
- The 'loadout' listed under CV/L entries details the number of planes each unit gets; eg. Unicorn gets 3 Fighters / 0 Dive Bombers / 3 Torpedo Bombers.
- The asterisk next to a name in the Priority List means the Kai is tied to some sort of event and may not be available right now; also, if you do not see a name in it, it's because it is not worth prioritizing.
- No, Izumo isn't missing from the PRiority list. She's just worthless. More details on why [here](https://github.com/YourWaifuIsShip/Azur-Lane-Guides/blob/master/AL%20Untier%20Guide.md).
- If you're wondering why carriers are judged differently from the rest, consider the following - they have no self-defence capabilities against suicide boats and are inherently worse than big guns at handling hard targets due to ordnance scatter and unhelpful anti-Heavy modifiers, but their AoE damage dispatches waves better than big guns usually do and come stock with screen clears.
tldr; BB/BC and CV/CVL do different things, holding them to the same standards makes little sense.
- **TIERLESS MEANS YOU NOW HAVE TO READ THE DESCRIPTIONS INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE IRRELEVANT ARBITRARY ACCURSED TIER NUMBERS. YOUR QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE UNIT IS FOUND IN THE ROLES FIELD. ENJOY.**
- **READ THE DAMN DESCRIPTIONS OR GHOSTLY HORSES WILL HAUNT YOU IN YOUR SLEEP.**

### DD ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/45px-DD_img40.png "DD Icon")
---
![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/Allen_M._SumnerChibi.png "Allen") - **[USS Allen M. Sumner](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Allen_M_Sumner)** 
* Roles:
  * **Medium AA carry, AA buffer, generalist DD**; light tank, above average DPS (split between guns, torps and barrages).

* Skill:
  * Ignitions taken last -3s and deal +15% dmg to Light Armour. Every 20s, 70% chance to fire a [mixed barrage](https://streamable.com/97g703) and grant +20% AA to the entire fleet for 8s.
    * The 17 STARLETS deal 30 bdmg with 110/110/100 mods; the 5 TORPEDOES deal 101 bdmg with 80/100/130 mods. The starlets are modified by 100% of the unit's FP, the torpedoes by 100% of the unit's Torp. 
  * If sortied with 2+ USS units OR after Allen sinks 2+ enemies, gain +15% Torp/AA until the end of the battle. Upon equipping any piece of USS gear, gain a special ghost AA mount.
    * The ghost AA deals 142 bdmg at 100% AAEff, has 30 range and a 1.04s reload.

- Desc:
>The most accomplished flyswatter in her hull class, Allen shreds the skies with a prowess matched only by the higher end AA CL (and beaten only by the Trio of Flyer Doom, namely San Diego / Cheshire / Isuzu) while retaining solid DPS on the sea and a sturdy enough hull to weather the storms coming her way.  
As is customary for USS DD, neither her guns nor her torpedoes are particularly noteworthy and their lack of quality is made up by quantity, again in the form of the aforementioned barrages. Have care that they hit; given their somewhat wide pattern, that would be more likely on a mobbing fleet.  


![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/CassinChibi.png "Cassin Kai") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/DownesChibi.png "Downes Kai")- **[USS Cassin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Cassin#Retrofit)** **[USS Downes Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Downes#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * When HP falls under 20%, heals 25% of max HP once per battle
  * 60% chance to activate every 20 seconds, increase own Reload by 40% for 10 seconds

- Desc: The bubblewrap fights back!
>Packing a lot of Firepower for destroyers and blessed with a decent Reload buff to go along the excellent self-heal, Cassin and Downes may not have the monstrous damage output of their IJN counterparts but they can and will outlast them many times over.  
As it is for Phoenix, they are best used in mobbing fleets.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/Charles_AusburneChibi.png "Charles Ausburne") - **[USS Charles Ausburne](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Charles_Ausburne)**
* Roles:
  * **Part of the USS Fletcher Trio** (off-tank, secondary buffer).
 
* Skill:
  * 4% activation upon firing, increases Fleet movement speed, and Escort evasion by 40% for 8s
  * 60% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40% for 10s.

* Desc: 
>Another slippery little bastard, obsessed with justice and GOING FAST.  
Her torps are fairly worthless, but her guns are decent and her skill is absolutely amazing - not only does she increase your whole frontline's survivability, she also fixes whatever movement issues you might have at hand. The best DD friend your CAs could ever have.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/CooperChibi.png "Smoltimore") - **[USS Cooper](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Cooper)**
* Role:
  * Dedicated ASW DD.
  
* Skill:
  * Every 20s, gain +15% FP, reveal all enemy submarines for 10s and launch an ASW airstrike; also, if equipped with PBY-5A Catalina and HP falls below 40%, launch a special airstrike. Only works once for battle.
    * (20s Airstrike) The 1 BOMB deals 84 bdmg w/ 100/50/20 armour modifiers. The damage is modified by 100% of Cooper's ASW stat.
    * (Spc Airstrike) The 4 BOMBS deal 456 bdmg w/ 70/105/125 armour modifiers. The damage is modified by 120% of Cooper's Torp stat.
  
- Desc: 
>Fairly competent ASW DD with the same jack-of-all-trades-ish statline most USS DD get, plus a minor FP boost; as per usual, it makes for a decently rounded performance with relatively good AA to boot.  
Make no mistake, though, her main job is ASW: and in that regard she's fortunate not to have to use a sonar to reveal submarines, an aux slot that may be filled with a Catalina if you wish to give her some more ASW prowess and/or a sucker punch to whatever managed to drop her HP low enough (an unlikely prospect, and an unwanted one to boot). The regular ASW airstrike is just a single Catalina dropping one bomb, so expect little from it.  
Meme but alright.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/EldridgeChibi.png "Pikachu")- **[USS Eldridge](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Eldridge)**
* Roles:
  * Dead PvP meme. Still annoying.

* Skill:
  * Upon taking damage, 15% chance to make entire escort fleet to evade all attacks for 10s. DoT and Ramming damage still apply. CAN'T PROC BEFORE 20s HAVE PASSED (skill starts on cooldown).

* Desc: 
>Slippery little bastard, despite her CA-like movement speed. Her offensive stats are somewhat lacklustre, but she makes up for it with her skill - it might be RNG and her high Evasion works against it, but 10s of invulnerability is nothing to scoff at. Make sure to have her eat weak shots to minimise exposure to danger.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/FletcherChibi.png "USS Fletcher") - **[USS Fletcher](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fletcher)**
* Roles:
  * **Part of the USS Fletcher Trio** (as flagship buffer).

* Skill:
  * Increases Firepower and Evasion of all Fletcher-Class in fleet by 30%
  * Increases Firepower, Torpedo, and Reload of DDs in the fleet by 10%

* Desc: 
>Lynchpin of the Fletcher Trio, think of her as an USS Z1 with a greater focus on gunnery as opposed to torps, as befitting her nation's doctrine. Very solid and dependable, but obviously better with other Fletchers.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/LaffeyKaiChibi.png "Gun Bun") - **[USS Laffey Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Laffey#Retrofit)**
* Roles:
  * **Notorious DPS machine** (very high Reload). Deceptively flimsy.

* Skill:
  * 5% activation upon firing, increases own FP, Reload, and Evasion by 40% for 8s.
  * Every 20 seconds, has a 70% chance to active Vanquish Mode, increasing own Reload stat by 200% for 10 seconds and releasing a powerful barrage.

- Desc: Vorpal Bunny.
>While pretty good to begin with, once Kai'd Laffey truly stands out thanks to CL-tier amounts of Firepower and Efficiency coupled with absurd amounts of Reload, allowing her to akimbo gun down any fool standing in her way. Her torpedoes also come out much quicker than anyone else's, but given the lacking nature of US torps spamming them is one of the few ways to keep them relevant.  
The DPS monster to AyaKai's DPH.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/MauryChibi.png "USS Maury") - **[USS Maury](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Maury)**
* Skill:
  * 40% chance every 10s to raise evasion by 60% for 8s
  * Upon launching torpedoes, 30% chance to launch a second spread

* Desc: 
>Good double torpedoes and merely okay guns? On my USS DD? It's more likely than you think.  
Maury does things differently from many of her colleagues, but she does them well - despite not quite reaching the torp heights of the IJN or the gunnery of the KMS, she strikes a comfortable balance between the two factions and proves a reliable, independent addition to most fleets.


![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/NicholasKaiChibi.png "Nicholas Kai") - **[USS Nicholas Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nicholas#Retrofit)**
* Role:
**Part of the USS Fletcher Trio** (as main tank and main DPS).

* Skill:
  * 5% chance upon firing to +40% her own Evasion and -40% damage received from planes for 8s
  * 60% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower for 8s
  * 70% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower/Torpedo/Reload for 10s and, once per battle, if an escort ship's Health falls below 20%, decrease the damage it takes by 15%. If the ship is Helena, additionally heal 8% of Helena's max Health

- Desc:
>Nicholas is a rarity among destroyers, in that she boasts both enough Firepower to face off with the best in her class and very solid defensive capabilities; a true generalist, even more so than Laffey considering her actually good torpedoes.  
With no real weakness on display, beyond simply not being quite as good as more specialised units, Nicholas is a worthy addition in pretty much any escort fleet - especially one with Helena or Fletcher.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/AmazonKaiChibi.png "HMS Amazon Kai")- **[HMS Amazon Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Amazon#Retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * Allied DDs in the fleet gain +18% experience.
  * Upon battle start and for 80s afterwards, deal +15% damage, take -8% damage and reduce the damage taken by allied DDs by -12% damage.
  * Has AAGM+1.

* Desc: 
>Nobody truly expected this to happen, but somehow Amazon's Kai turned out to be... somewhat alright!  
Certainly as an AA barge at least, whenever her double AA mount is allowed to do work, but she's also alright in terms of DPS and staying power; still, her niche is of questionable relevance so it's unlikely she'll see much use, but worth keeping in mind nonethless.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/EskimoChibi.png "Pingu") - **[HMS Eskimo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Eskimo)**
* Role:
  * **Light self-healing DD tank**, medium DD Gun DPS, below average DD Torp DPS.
  
* Skill:
  * Every 30s, launch a special [barrage](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742730234893172796/742730440154152960/Eskimo-Barrage.gif); upon falling below 30% HP, heal 10% of max HP back and launch a special barrage (only one proc per battle). Those barrages are the same.
    * The 17 shots deal 24 bdmg with 100/100/100 armour mods. They are modified by 100% of the unit's FP.

- Desc: 
>Finally, a competent enough HMS DD! Sure, her staying power is somewhat questionable if exposed to heavy fire and its damage output is just alright, but a self-heal is always appreciated and if you main HMS, you don't really get to be picky with your DD choices.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/JavelinKaiChibi.png "Javelin Kai") - **[HMS Javelin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Javelin#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Evasion by 60% for 8s.
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost torpedo stat by 30% for 8s.

* Desc: 
>While her starter version is pretty much undeniably the worst out of the three, the Kai does her some justice. Still nowhere as powerful as Ayanami or Laffey, but the EX barrage helps to close the gap to some extent... alas, the Evasion boost still accomplishes little due to powerful diminishing returns the stat incurs, with little to show for it.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/AyanamiKaiChibi.png "Ayanami Kai") - **[IJN Ayanami Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ayanami#Retrofit)** 
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Torpedo by 60% for 8s
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost Evasion stat by 30% for 5s

* Desc: Nuclear Launch Detected.
>Ayanami is the last word in Torp Damage - with her skill procced, the damage she can inflict with them is completely unrivaled and, with enough buff stacking, can even reach the tens of thousands.  
On the flip side, Torpedoes are all she's got and once she's blown her load, she won't have much to do except waiting for them to come back online; and given how massively overkill her torpedoes tend to be, it would be advisable to deploy her in boss fights first, foremost and only.  
The DPH monster to LafKai's DPS.

#### ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/HanazukiChibi.png "Hanazuki") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/HarutsukiChibi.png "Harutsuki") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/YoizukiChibi.png "Yoizuki")- **[IJN Hanazuki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hanazuki)** **[IJN Harutsuki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Harutsuki)** **[IJN Yoizuki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yoizuki)**
* Role:
  * AA support, light hybrid DPS with solid staying power.

* Skill:
  * When planes are shot down within the AA circle, +25% own AA and Firepower for 8s.

- Desc:
>New-and-improved Niizukis, now with half the clothing and a better AA skill. While DDs aren't particularly good at AA, they do get Main Gun +1 and their skill actively encourages hunting those planes down. Decent even when planes aren't around, better when there are and surprisingly tough.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/HibikiChibi.png "Hibiki") - **[IJN Hibiki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hibiki)**
* Skill:
  * Upon launching a torpedo spread, 30% chance to launch a second one; also, once per fight upon falling below 20% HP, heal back up by 20%.
  * If sortied with any other Akatsuki-class DD (Akatsuki, Inazuma, Ikazuchi), gain +15% FP/Torp/Reload.
  * Every 20s, 30% chance to lower an enemy's Reload by -30% and Damage by -15% for 10s (targets humanoid ships first).

* Desc: IJN Mahan!
>The IJN finally gets in on the self-healing action, and it does so in its own peculiar - read, torp-heavy and guns-light - way.  
An interesting proposition but one that is for the most part only going to appeal to dedicated torp-heavy vanguards, as the Mahans are much cheaper and much more effective in their role of unshiftable-yet-adequately-armed bubblewrap, but she can be put to good use if one is willing to manual and invest on torp buffers.  
Forget about the self-buff if sortied with Akatsuki-class DDs, they aren't worth using in the first place unless you particularly like them.  

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/KagerouKaiChibi.png "Lil Miss Paperbag") - **[IJN Kagerou Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kagerou#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * Grant +15% Torpedo to the entire vanguard.
  * Upon launching a torpedo spread, 30% chance to launch a second one.
  * Every 20s, 30% chance to lower an enemy's Reload by -30% and Damage by -15% for 10s (targets humanoid ships first).

* Desc: 
>Widely available early on and blessed with both excellent skills and a very solid statline, Kagerou has a place in every torp-heavy frontline (torp-CA in particular, as they typically do not have access to torpedo buffs). Her Kai is more of a slight upgrade than a massive change, with her skill being middling at best, but the extra stats are appreciated nonetheless.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/KazagumoChibi.png "Small Hands Gumo") - **[IJN Kazagumo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kazagumo)**
* Roles:
  * **Strong CV/L cheerleader, torpedo spammer**. High torpedo DPS.

* Skill:
  * Gain +5% Torp and +15% Reload; also, whenever this unit launches her regular barrage, take 3s away from the unit's torpedo cooldown.
  * Grant +15% damage to CV/L (DOES NOT STACK with the generic +15% damage to CV/L skill). Upon firing the 4th torpedo spread, heal the CV/L with the lowest HP by 10% of its max HP, and if the flagship is a CV, the unit will be healed by +15% of its max HP instead.

* Desc: *Ey, I'm torpin' 'ere!*
>A cut above most other CV/L cheerleaders and considerably more reliable than most other IJN Torp-DDs, owing to her very solid statline and torpedo spread acceleration gimmick. Burst damage is good and all, but sometimes you'd rather just pop more than pop harder - and mob fleets tend to be carrier territory more so than big guns'.  
Her regular barrage is also fairly ideal for the task and is the main incentive for using accelerators such as the usual 120x1 or 76x1, dealing fairly significant damage on [a linear, reasonably narrow](https://gyazo.com/a02b1d4b0388a01dec99ebadfc105362) pattern.  
Don't ask about the Brooklyn accent. Blame Littorio's mistress.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/KawakazeChibi.png "Not Shirakami Fubuki") - **[IJN Kawakaze](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kawakaze)**
* Skill:
  * All IJN DD deal +15% damage to CL/CA.
  * Her torpedoes always deal 115% damage against all targets, regardless of the normal torpedo modifiers (80/100/130)

* Desc: Black Not Shooter.
>A veritable turncoat of a DD, Kawakaze's main purpose is making Light Armoured units' lives hell by drilling right through it with her torps and her stellar torpedo-armed barrage - and she accomplishes it beautifully.  
Terrifyingly effective against her intended targets, to the point of overtaking even Ayanami Kai - but she does still lose to her when faced with Heavy Armour, against which her skill puts her at a disadvantage.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/KitakazeChibi.png "Kitakaze") - **[IJN Kitakaze](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kitakaze)**
* Skill:
  * Main Gun modifiers are fixed to 115/115/115; also, gain +15% Main Gun Efficiency if using an IJN DD gun.
  * 10s after the start of the battle, launch a torpedo barrage and take -6% damage for 50s; also, upon hitting with 8 NON-BARRAGE torpedoes, launch the same torpedo barrage.
  * Deal +15% dmg to Sirens.
  * Has MGM+1.

* Desc: 
>Always liked the Akizuki-class's DDakka and disliked their lack of anything resembling proper firepower?  
Well, look no further, for Kitakaze dispenses with the flimsy pretense of being an AA DD like the others and goes all-in on surface weaponry - from the supercharged twinned DD gun rocking high FP and Eff with fixed 115% modifiers across the board to the solid regular/barrage torpedo suite, Kitakaze is more than capable of taking on any sort of foe and coming out on top handily (helped also by her exceptionally high HP).  
Fits any comp, is downright murderous against Heavy. Brilliant.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/KuroshioChibi.png "Kuroshio") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/OyashioChibi.png "Oyashio")- **[IJN Kuroshio](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kuroshio)** **[IJN Oyashio](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Oyashio)**
* Skill:
  * 30% chance upon torpedo launch to launch a second spread
  * 60% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower for 8s

* Role:
  * IJN DD/CL torpedo vanguard buffer, high torpedo DPS.

* Skill:
  * 10s after the start of the battle, launch a torpedo spread; every 20s afterwards and on a 25% chance, launch a torpedo spread. The torpedoes' power and amount are the same as that of those currently equipped.
  * Upon battle start, if Naganami is sortied in the middle of a full vanguard, grant +15% Torp and +10% Torp CritRate to DD/CL and +15% Eva to DDs.

* Desc: 
>By and large an alternative to Kagerou Kai, as their statlines are almost identical but their focus differs slightly.  
Whereas Kagerou Kai buffs the entire vanguard regardless of amount of members and hull class, CAs included, Naganami buffs DD/CL more (and especially DDs, though the +Eva is mostly negligible on units with such a high Eva stat already); the 'free' torpedo spreads aren't as reliable as the Chain Torpedo Kagerou brings, as they are timer-based rather than on-launch, but are still fairly good.

* Skill:
  * 25% chance every 20s, Increase entire fleet's Reload by 25% for 8s (does not stack with multiple instances of the same skill)
  * 25% chance on firing AA guns to boost AA by 40% and reduce Firepower by 20% for 3s. Has MGM+1.

* Desc: 
>An oddity among DDs and especially IJN ones, Niizuki focuses on AA and guns over torps - and does so with a decent measure of success, too.   
Despite her low FP and an AA skill actively hampering it, her MGM+1 and good Efficiency let her deal constant, solid damage regardless; she's no KMS or USS Gun-DD, but she puts up a good showing and still retains serviceable torps, as well as an unreliable but decent fleetwide buff.

- Desc: Javelin has been obsoleted. Again.  
>Poor starter just can't catch a break - first Yukikaze big dicks everyone else in her class (and beyond) in terms of sheer eHP while bringing good DPS and remarkable support, then Shigure joins in by either providing a higher-damage off-tank solution or by acting as a Yukikaze-lite if she's on her own.  
That aside, she behaves in the usual IJN DD fashion - no torps means no DPS, so make the spreads count.

* Skill:
  * For every IJN unit in the fleet and/or upon shooting down 2 planes in the AA circle, gain a +5% FP/AA stack (up to 6 stacks).
  * 3s after battle start, deploy a Smokescreen (+40% EvaRate within smoke, 5s duration) and fire a [barrage](https://streamable.com/pqt761); every 15s afterwards, fire the barrage again and on a 30% chance, deploy another Smokescreen; also, upon falling below 20% HP, heal back 15% of max HP (once per battle).
    * The 40 SHOTS deal 16 bdmg with 100/80/60 armour modifiers; the 8 TORPEDOES deal 54 bdmg with 80/100/130 armour modifiers. Both are modified by 100% of the respective relevant stats.

- Desc: 
>An Akizuki-class done properly, at long last, sporting a very tough (and self-repairing) hull for her weight and an impressive array of guns in a neat, IJN-flavoured package well capable of shaming most of the competition. Don't fret about the IJN stack gain condition, either: so long as she has at least a few planes overhead to pop, she'll be gaining those stacks just fine.  
Do fret, however, about her consistency; while she's nowhere near as unreliable as her fellow IJN self-healer, Hibiki, her impresssive DPS still does come down in significant part to the barrages, and without manual control (which is recommended anyway, this being a DD and all) they may fire off at inopportune times or inopportune places.  
Truly excellent nevertheless.

  * 25% chance to activate when taking damage, decreases said damage to 1. 
  * Her regular barrage includes 4 conventional torpedoes.

* Desc: She protecc, she attacc, but most importantly, she tsun catt.
>Nowhere as devastating as her tier companions (or a good few other IJN DDs for that matter), she is nonetheless quite powerful and has incredible defensive skills for both herself and the backline.

* Desc: 
>Z1 Kai read Z23 Kai's damn book and has learnt an EX barrage of her own, as well as a few other tricks, and as a result can now put out some remarkable DPS of her own while offering some measure of protection from planes.

  * Every time the main gun is fired 10 times, gain +5% Reload and +20% Barrage damage. Can be stacked 4 times. 

* Desc: 
>Z2 takes the concept of 'barrage boat' very literally.  
Not entirely unlike a few other DDs, most of Z2's DPS comes straight from her barrage rather than anything else; unlike them, however, this is by design and both her skills reinforce that notion, meaning she's at her best when manually controlled and firing non-stop and on the backfoot when she's not.  
Limited in scope but potentially very good at her job, given enough books.

  * Every 20 seconds, has a 40% (70%) chance to active Destruction Mode, releasing a powerful barrage and spawning 2 rotating shields that can block 5 enemy shells each, and for 10 seconds own main gun critical rate becomes 100%.
  * Can equip CL guns, but shouldn't.

* Desc:
>Z23 takes the opposite approach to Ayanami, in that she goes all in on guns - her base FP is unmatched among DDs and her skills further ehnance her gun DPS to obscene degrees, while also having great uptime.  
Torps are even more of an afterthought than they are on Laffey, however, and unlike Laffey she can't make up for it by simply spamming them; she will punch ship-sized holes in Light and Medium Armour, but she'll find herself a little stumped against Heavy.

    * The 66 SHOTS deal 20 bdmg with 100/80/60 mods; they are modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * Can equip CL guns (but shouldn't).

* Desc: 
>Tries to be Z1. Isn't.  
Still okay-ish... if you for some reason don't want to use the obviousy superior option, or somehow deem the ASW/AA boost valuable. Or lack components for the Z Trio.

>Z35 takes a page from Laffey's book and kicks her guns into overdrive, putting them to similar effect (and wrekcing them in the process for a few seconds).  
Very similar in behaviour to her USS counterpart, but whereas she can run a one-bunny show thanks to her Kai statline and skills, Z35 needs Z1's presence to really compare; and while she won't be matching her anytime soon, she'll still be giving many other DDs a run for their money.

* Skill:
  * At the start of battle and every 20s afterwards, launch a special barrage (a few HE shots in a cone, two waves of 5 and 4 torpedoes respectively) and gain +24% FP/Torp; the buff loses potency and expires over the next 20s.

- Desc:
>Through the sheer power of chuunibyou, Z36 gets to carry extra ordnance and lob it at her enemies every 20s while buffing herself in the process.
The tempo she forces upon you is fairly demanding, as the average DD torpedo set reloads in 21-22s and that leaves you precious little time to position yourself for an attack run at full power, but if you can keep up the DPS is fairly remarkable; if you can't, however, you'll be stuck with middling efficiencies and no buff to rescue them.

* Role:
  * **Z-class vanguard DPS (barrage-focused)**, light AA support.

* Skill:
  * Whenever enemy planes are shot down within own AA range, increase FP by 15% of own total AA stat (Only base stat and gear is counted) and if skill procs again during its duration, it refreshes the buff
  * Increases AP damage by 25%
  
* Desc:
>Don't let the kit or the (admittedly excellent by DD standards) AA efficiency; Z46 is a very capable barrage barge ~~(barrarge?)~~ that just so happens to throw a little AA in the mix, not nearly enough to bother actual flying threats.
Proud owner of a quick-firing, high-volume, AP conal barrage with four homing torpedoes to the side that is boosted both by her own +APdmg skill (only use the recently released golden KMS DD AP gun or stick with the usual quick-firing solutions) and her high torp stat, she puts every other standard DD barrage in the game to shame and is the main reason for her remarkable prowess. That said, like most KMS DD, her normal torpedoes are pretty bad and will bank on her gunnery to pull through.

* Roles:
  * **Floating medkit (heals a fellow vanguard on critical HP)**; good Gun DPS.

* Skill:
  * Upon battle start, gain +20% CritRate if not sortied alone; also, once per battle heal another vanguard whose HP fell below 20% by 10% of their max HP at the cost of 5% of Gromky's max HP (which will be healed back by 8% of her max HP 5s later).
  * Take -10% damage by DD guns and torpedoes. Every 20s, gain +5 Speed and +20% FP for 10s.

- Desc: MEEEEEEEDIC!
>A floating medkit with guns, Gromky's statline plays it straight with her nation's traits (tougher but less evasive hulls, strong guns, torpedoes so bad even Roon would laugh at them) and thankfully spices it up with a useful, if admittedly somewhat roundabout, vanguard heal.  
If you're taking her, that's the reason you're doing it - and it is a pretty good reason, if you're concerned about a vanguard dying on you and your backline's too busy DPSing to bring healers.

* Skill:
  * Upon battle start, gain +10% FP and summon ~~Navi~~ an ice fairy for 50s, whose shots inflict 1 stack of -1.5% Speed for 4s (max 10 stacks; each icicle refreshes the 4s duration).
    * The 6 ICICLES deal 24 bdmg with 100/50/20 modifiers and a 125% Coefficient; the icicles are fired every 2s in two three-icicle bursts, which can be aimed at two different targets.
  * Upon battle start, grant +10% Main Gun Efficiency and +15% Accuracy to all Northern Parliament DDs armed with Northern Parliament guns.

- Desc: L'incrociatore blu.
>Also known as the "Blue Cruiser", this Italian-born destroyer leader entirely deserves her moniker; her statline is hilariously stacked, with an eHP well capable of rivaling even the tough Cleveland-class light cruisers and a Firepower that actually overtakes them (to a not insignificant degree, when factoring both her Efficiencies and DD guns).  
The historical records are curiously silent on the subject of suspiciously familiar-looking guardian faeries, but one cannot fault her effectiveness nonetheless: for all the 50s she's active it puts out a shocking amount of DPS, roughly equivalent to that of a second gun mount backed by her stats, and also doles out a little bit of slows along the way (not too relevant, but it's better than nothing anyway).  
Impressive as she is, Tashkent does have a couple of drawbacks; first of all is her damage output, heavily slanted towards Light (both her ideal gun and the fairy have Normal DD ammo modifiers), and secondly is the simple fact her DPS does drop quite significantly once the fairy pops. While this does not exactly force her into a mob fleet role, it is nevertheless where she is bound to be most effectively deployed.

  * Upon battle start, gain +10% FP and summon ~~Navi~~ an ice fairy for 50s, whose shots inflict a -5% Aviation Damage Taken debuff upon enemies hit by them 10 times.
    * The 6 ICICLES deal 24 bdmg with 100/50/20 modifiers and a 125% Coefficient; the icicles are fired every 2s in two three-icicle bursts, which can be aimed at two different targets.
  * For the first three battles of the sortie, gain +12% FP; for the fourth battle and onwards, gain +12% AA.

- Desc: A somewhat pallid imitation of the original.
>Musekent behaves almost exactly like the normal Tashkent while performing somewhat worse; the hefty extra Efficiency on the main guns is gone in favour of a fairly negligible carrier-minded debuff (potency is too low) and a FP boost that eventually melts away in favour of AA she can't actually use.  
Is she bad? No, she's still a Taskhent and this means she's still a beast with a few caveats. Is she worse than Tashkent? Yes.

  * Upon battle start, gain +20% Torp/Eva for 30s; over the next 20s, the buff potency lowers to 0%.

- Desc:
>Le Malin shares both Le Triomphant's statline and the "hit the same target" gimmick, but makes it a lot more lenient and considerably more effective besides.

      * The 4 BOMBS deal 220 bdmg with 80/90/110 amods. They are modified by 60% of the unit's Torpedo stat, and are thus unaffected by enemy AA.
  * Gain +20% FP and a further +3% FP (up to +9%) for every enemy destroyed. Take -5% damage and, every 25s, heal all DD in the fleet by 3% of their max HP.

- Desc:
>Le Memin returns to the fore as an angelic idol while retaining the kit concept behind the original: very good gunnery, valuable if quirky support, middling torpedoes, excessive amounts of speed.  
The quirks are especially notable this time around, even if her moment-to-moment play doesn't change all that much. The 3s stops are the most notable item on the list, and are more of a boon than a detriment (will prevent ramming on auto and not slow the vanguard significantly); the mini-airstrikes she throws out are remisnescent of Shirakami Fubuki, with the same AA bypass and more bombs; the heals are somewhat more consistent and welcome, if not quite enough to sustain her under heavy fire.

>Despite the higher efficiency AA, slightly better torps and slightly worse guns, Libeccio's (and by extension Maestrale's) statline is more or less akin to Carabiniere's - meaning, tough little gunboat-ish thingies that are mostly reliant on their skills for relevance.  
In her case, it's a nifty barrage proccing on damage taken by anyone but her on a 15s cooldown with a wide pattern and pretty alright damage, meant for mob fleets more so than anything else. Decent utility.

Considering how often a vanguard gets pelted with sprinkles or the backline tickled by planes, when not accompanied by AA-capable units, the chances of it firing up are very high; the smokescreen is also worth a mention, not because it's good at its intended job (smokescreens never are) but because it can proc a lot faster, meaning you could realistically get some use out of them even on auto.

>The first ever legitimately good collaboat, Not Kawakaze marries a typically IJN DD statline to a gushing love for modern military aircraft - so much so that she lugs a pair around instead of AA guns and has one swinging by every 20s to bomb her foes.  
The trade is a net positive. While two 80% Dive Bombers and 201 Aviation make for very weak airstrikes, she loses nothing of value (IJN AA is by and large terrible, and IJN DD AA is usually worst in hull class) for it while gaining some 'free damage' and, more importantly, a quick-firing screenclear no other vanguard in the game can claim to have; as for the other skills they're alright, somewhat low-impact but appreciated nonetheless.  
One can only hope we'll see more DDVs like this one in the future.

Fairly straightforward, extremely capable.


### Pro Team Players:

#### ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/An_ShanChibi.png "Anshan") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/Chang_ChunChibi.png "Changchun") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/Fu_ShunChibi.png "Fushun") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/Tai_YuanChibi.png "Taiyuan") - [PRAN Anshan](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/An_Shan), [PRAN Changchun](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Chang_Chun), [PRAN Fushun](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fu_Shun) [PRAN Taiyuan](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Tai_Yuan)
* Skill (Anshan): While in combat, Anshan-class (all PRAN) ships have increased Accuracy, Firepower by 25% and evasion by 10%
* Skill (Changchun): Increases Firepower, Reload and Accuracy by 12% for all North Union and Eastern Radiance (ROC, PRAN) ships in fleet.
* Skill (Fushun): Increase own main gun's critical rate by 20%.
* Skill (Taiyuan): While in combat with 6 ships in the fleet, increase own Firepower and Reload by 25%, and evasion by 10%.

- Description:
Use Fushun if you don't want to pony up for a full fleet: her DPS won't be as stable as Taiyuan's, but she won't be far off and you'll be burning a lot less Oil.
 
#### ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/ForbinKaiChibi.png "Forbin Kai") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/Le_MarsKaiChibi.png "Mars Black")- **[FFNF Forbin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Forbin#retrofit)** **[MNF Le Mars Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Le_Mars#retrofit)**
* Skill (Forbin):
  * If the vanguard only fields FFNF/MNF units and every 20s, 50% chance to grant the entire fleet -30% damage taken for 8s.
  * Every 20s, 30% chance to avoid all incoming damage for 6s.

* Skill (Le Mars):
  * If the vanguard only fields FFNF/MNF units and every 20s, 50% chance to grant the entire fleet +25% Damage for 8s.
  * Every 20s, 30% chance to avoid all incoming damage for 6s.

* Desc: 
>Vaguely reminiscent of HMS DDs in both defence, offence and skillset quality, Le Mars and Forbin are a cut slightly above them - but not quite enough to make them worth taking in their own right.  
Still, if you're willing to field a full french vanguard (and you do have good options for that, namely Saint Louis and Emile Bertin), the buffs they provide are quite substantial.

* Desc: Cheap and inexpensive bubblewrap.
>While their Kai does augment their DPS somewhat, it's fair to say that the star of the show is still their self-rescue skill and their pretty good base HP; therefore, if all you want are some ablative wounds for a more valuable unit or just something to stall with while the backline does all the work, there are no better options than a 0LB Cassin and Downes.

#### ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/dc/AmazonChibi.png "HMS Amazon") [HMS Amazon](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Amazon)
* Skill:
  * +18% Exp gain for DDs.

* Desc: 
>The first real DD to hit the seas, and boy does it show. Her barely combat-worthy statline and lack of any skill beyond the XP boost makes her a very poor candiate for Limit Breaks, and a very good candidate for 0LB shenanigans.

* Skill:
  * Every 20s, initiate RNG fiesta. (35% chance for -8% FP/Torp/Aviation to all enemies; 35% chance for -6%; 18% chance for -4%; 12% chance for +4% instead).
  * Upon taking damage, 12% chance to launch a torpedo barrage, become invincible for 3s and gain +40% Eva for 3s afterwards. This skill may only activate thrice per battle.

* Desc: AI-TAN BIIIIIMU!
>Also known as "Nowaki but not completely awful", DD AI is overall surprisingly okay - a decent statline, a reliable debuff and a nice-if-short lived defensive/offensive skill aren't enough to let her outshine the vast majority of proper DD (and the lack of a real barrage doesn't help), but she's still an interesting and fairly competent addition.

* Role:
  * **Medium Tank**, average Gun DPS, light AA support.

* Skill: 
  * If equipped with a Twin 127mm MK12 Dual Gun, gain +15% AA and lose -5% FP; if NOT equipped with it, gain +15% FP and lose -5% AA.
  * Once per fight and upon any ally falling below 50% HP, gain +15% AA and reduce the damage taken by that unit by -15% for 12s.

*  Desc: 
>Second best of the Cleveland-class, chiefly by virtue of... acknowledging their limits?
Ever since the game moved on from those early worlds (W8 or W9), the Clevelands have struggled to find their footing; CL guns, once preferred to CA guns because faster to reload and unlikely to overkill targets, are severely underpowered... as is their AA, when facing the nippon flying steel of W12 or swarms of W13.  
Biloxi does not actually solve these problems, but does mitigate them by doing away with those early low-proc skills like Full Firepower in favour of passive buffs; out of the two, the one most likely to aid is the +FP -AA, not least because the 127x2 is a fairly poor gun.  
Also, she can defend a fellow vanguard that's taking too many hits. That's okay.

  * Upon taking damage (and on a 8s internal cooldown), 10% chance to gain +40% Evasion for 5s; once per battle and upon falling below 30% HP, lock EvaRate to 100% for 5s.

- Desc: 
>A slightly sturdier than usual Cleveland who performs better rather than worse when planes are around.  
Not much to say about her, she's solid and unremarkable like the rest of her class (Montpelier notwithstanding).

* Role:
  * **Very high Gun DPS**, medium self-healing tank.

  * Every 15s, fire an [aimed barrage](https://streamable.com/44t8bz) at the closest enemy. Also, gain +10% CritRate and deal +15% dmg to Heavy Armour.
    * The 12 AP SHOTS deal 10 bdmg with 80/100/120 armour modifiers. They are modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * While above 45% HP, gain +15% FP/AA; while below 45% HP, take -15% Ignition dmg. Upon falling below 30% HP, heal back by 10% of her max HP.

*  Desc: 
>Expectations were low when this Brooklyn-class CL was announced, given the poor performance of Gun-CLs as a whole, but this one somewhat bucks the trend.  
Owing to her gunnery self-buffs, a desperately needed anti-Heavy boost and aimed barrage, and the little self-heal, Boise can rebreathe easy as she does her part (though as ever, do not expect her to shoot up).

  * 25% chance every 20s to boost Damage fleetwide by 25%
  * 25% upon firing AA guns, -20% own FP and +40% own AA for 3s.

- Desc: Original Dadster.
>A new player mainstay, for good or ill, Cleveland has helped many a newbie reach the higher leagues with her plucky go-getter attitude, remarkable bulk and generally good all-around stats; nevertheless, she becomes obsolete quickly as those same higher leagues (W10+) ramp up enemy bulk and damage output beyond her capabilities to dispatch them efficiently, and her skills help her or the fleet little.

![CL](/Images-for-the-Guide/Cleveland_(Muse)Chibi.png "Muse Cleveland") - **[Muse Cleveland](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Cleveland_(Muse))**
* Role:
  * **Medium Tank**, average Gun DPS, light AA support.

* Skill: 
  * Every 15s, change Main Gun ammo to musical notes (120/120/90 modifiers, penetrates once) for 8s.
  * Whenever a plane is shot down, gain a +8% AA stack for 8s; can gain up to 4 stacks.

- Desc:

She's okay.

  * 25% upon firing AA guns, -20% own FP and +40% own AA for 3s.

- Desc:
>Ever wanted to use Hammann but didn't want to deal with her terrible stats and weaponry? Well, now you can.

![CL](/Images-for-the-Guide/HelenaKaiChibi.png "Esugee") - **[USS Helena Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Helena#retrofit)**
* Role:
  * **Boss debuffer supreme**, heavy Gun DPS, medium tank, medium AA support.

* Skill:
  * 60% chance every 20s, inflict a -40% damage resistance debuff on all enemies currently on the screen. If mounting a SG Radar, gain +10% Evasion and the first proc attempt occurs at 16s instead of 20s.
  * Take -15% Torpedo damage. Upon battle start, if there are three units in the vanguard and the last unit in it is USS (and isn't her), grant it +12% Evasion.

* Desc: 
>Helena Kai is exceedingly good against bosses and merely alright everywhere else.  
While the power of her debuff is unparalled, it's hard to make sure she will proc when you need her to - either because the enemy has died already or there's no worthy targets on the screen, as tends to happen on mob nodes, or because it just won't proc due to bad luck; only boss fights tend to drag on for long enough to guarantee her debuff will proc and get some use, so long as you can make sure the fleet will be ready to strike when she does.  
Do not give her a SG Radar, as it will severely hinder your fleet's ability to exploit the burst windows Helena creates and the +10% Evasion barely makes up for the loss in Evasion she would suffer by not taking the usual PR Rudder.

  * 25% chance upon firing AA guns, -20% own FP and +40% own AA for 3s.

- Desc:
> Creme de la creme of the Cleveland class by virtue of a slightly superior statline (compared to her sisters'), an absolute bomb of a Cruiser buffing skill, and surprising amounts of Luck to make the most out of her already sturdy build.

* Desc: 
>Sturdy, cost-effective and perfectly capable of carrying a fleet through multiple battles with no healing support, Phoenix is a supremely reliable workhorse for any fleet; whether it's farming or a cheeky way to skimp on healers to ramp up the backline damage, she'll get it done.

* Role:
  * Carrier defender; mob/boss fleet high DPS and **heavy AA carry**.

* Skill:
  * Upon battle start and if there is 1+ alive CV/L in the fleet, gain +35% CritRate. For every alive CV/L in the fleet, deal +10% Dmg to DD/CL (up to +30%). For the first four battles of her fleet, CV/L in her fleet take -10% Dmg.
  * Upon battle start, gain +15% AA and +15% FP. Every 2nd time the backline takes damage, gain a stack of +6% AA/FP until the end of the fight (can gain 2 stacks max).
  * +10% Main Gun Efficiency if wielding a DD gun.

* Desc: Protector of mAAnkind.
>Another great entry in the ever-expanding roster of USS flyswatters, Reno is a dedicated AA CL sporting surprisingly high DPS - not too far off from a San Diego Kai in fact, which is no mean feat, especially against DD/CL - and an overwhelming urge to protect carriers.  
Most of her kit more or less revolves around carriers, in fact - she gains substantial boosts with them around and can defend them remarkably well with her boosted guns, an armour-modifiers-ignoring (100/100/100) barrage and a nifty damage reduction for the first few engagements she's in, something better suited to a mob fleet than a boss fleet.  
Wherever there are planes to shred and carriers to protect, Reno is at home - and the more there is of both, the better.

* Skill: 
  * 15% chance upon firing AA guns, +50% AA to the entire fleet for 8s
  * +25% own AA; every 20s, launches a special barrage (torrent of slightly homing stars behind her, 1/4 of the screen in width) 
  * Can equip DD guns, and should.

>They finally did it, the madmen. Not only they Kai'd Azur Lane's greatest meme, they even made her the hero she was always supposed to be - sporting one whole extra Main Gun Mount, some much needed markups in Firepower and Efficiency, a shiny new and dazzling (but ultimately not too powerful) barrage and EVEN MORE anti-air capabilities, neither the skies nor the seas present any challenge to the once most unwanted gold unit in the game.  
You'll still want to give her an Oxygen Torpedo or two, though - her torp stat remains abysmal, and even if it's not the torps you're taking her for there's no reason to let them rot. Besides, fireworks go great with a nice, starry night.

![CL](/Images-for-the-Guide/San_JuanChibi.png "San Juan") - **[USS San Juan](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/San_Juan)**
* Roles:
  * **San Diego alternative for USS fleets**, below average Gun DPS, low Torp DPS, light tank.

* Skill: 
  * Upon firing AA guns, 25% chance to grant +30% AA to ALL USS units in the fleet for 5s; also, every 13 main gun shots hits, gain a stack of +8% FP (max. 3 stacks)


* Desc: Smol Diego done right.
>Leagues bette than the travesty that was Lil Diego, San Juan very successfully emulates San Diego's main strength (strong fleetwide AA buff) while having some passable DPS of her own; stick her in with a USS fleet and watch them become murder incarnate to incoming aircraft.  
It goes without saying that she'll severely underperform if she's not going to assist USS units, of course.


![CL](/Images-for-the-Guide/SeattleChibi.png "Seattle") - **[USS Seattle](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Seattle)**
* Roles:
  * **Heavy AA carry and high Gun DPS** (if built for AA) or **Medium AA carry and very high Gun DPS** (if built for gunnery), **heavy tank**.

* Skill: 
  * If an aircraft is shot down within the AA circle, gain +15% FP/AA for 8s; if more than 15 aircraft have been shot down throughout the battle *or* if Air Control is at Parity or above, gain +15% FP and +20% Reload until the end of the battle.
  * If mounting a CL gun as secondary, gain +15% AA Efficiency; if mounting an AA gun as secondary, gain +15% Main Gun Efficiency; if placed as Vanguard Rear, take -15% less damage.
    * No, sortieing Seattle alone doesn't work. There is no vanguard rear when you're on your own, after all.
  * Deal +15% dmg to Sirens.
  * Can mount a CL gun or an AA gun as secondary.

* Desc: Scuttlefish.
>Yet another example of the modular buffing structure the USS displays as a whole, she has the potential to be useful in a variety of situations if outfitted and deployed accordingly; while her AA isn't as strong as San Diego's, her staying power isn't on par with Neptune's and her DPS falls behind that of her peers, Scuttle can nevertheless put up a remarkable show on all accounts
and endure a shocking amount of abuse in the process.  
Weird but potentially very good. Watch out for her loadout.

  * 25% chance on firing AA guns to boost AA by 40% and reduce Firepower by 20% for 3s

* Desc: 
>Lewdis' remarkable statline goes exceedingly well with a solid set of self-buffs to all relevant stats for a Gun-CL like herself, letting her withstand amounts of punishment that would fell a lesser CL or gun harder and faster than much of her competition.  
Beware the lack of support, though; while her AA isn't Helena-tier bad, it is still bad by CL standards, and her buffs only affect herself.

  * 10s after battle starts and on a 20% chance every 20s aftewards, create a special smokescreen (+35% Evasion Rate and-35% damage from planes while inside) that lasts 10s.

* Desc: Hot honeytrap maid.
>Dealing more damage than usual with HE guns and packing better torps than every other HMS cruiser, she tends to have a decent answer for most Light and Heavy Armour shaped issues - but not a great one on either side, and her smokescreen is almost entirely useless in PvE with its terrible procrate plus lower defence compared to the 'regular' screen and planes not attacking you.  
That said, the recent introduction of a CL HE gun that deigns itself to fire *straight* singlehandedly makes her considerably more combat-effective, if still lacking in support power.  
Her place is mostly PvP, as there are many other CL who will do what she does - be it DPS or tanking - better for less.

* Desc: Pretty fly for a white gal?
Take Sirius, strip her two-way carrier buff and the busted damage on her barrage, then replace them with massive buffs to her 'ordinary weaponry' and a bad ol' fart cloud - and this is what you get.  
All things considered she's a fairly good deal, providing stable and solid DPS with a side order of okay-ish support as long as you do stick her in with one USS unit. Not particularly hard to do, but not doing so makes her nearly worthless.

>Rescued from the brink of ignonimy by a timely Kai, Curlew got the injection of stats and efficienicies she desperately needed to be even a little relevant - as well as a useful little carrier buff.  
Nevertheless, she and her less fortunate sisters have always been the HMS answer to Isuzu and alas, they're not really - their DPS is abysmal owing to a poor statline to back the DD guns, and the AA suite is far from good enough to compete with their IJN rival (let alone the USS one). Still, they can provide solid AA and their double AA mount shenanigans may have a place when tinkering with the burst cooldowns may be necessary.

* Skill:
  * Grant +15% FP/Torp/AA to all Dido-class cruisers in the fleet; also, upon battle start, gain +15% AA/Evasion for 30s.
  * Gain a stack of +6% FP/AA/Reload for every HMS unit in the fleet (herself included, max 4 stacks); if QE is in the fleet, grant QE +7% FP/Evasion/Reload and +20% CritRate.
  * Can use DD guns, and should.

* Desc: Easy Access to Monkey Business.
> It was to be expected that the Dido-class flagship would be good; what was not expected is that she'd also make Queen Elizabeth not terrible anymore (still not a first pick though, alas; her base statline is too poor to be fixed *that* easily).  
As a standalone unit, she's an overall improved Sirius: the barrage is more powerful and easier to land, the statline is better across the board, the AA is actually good-to-excellent this time around and the buffs she gets are very significant, more so than those she grants.  
On the flipside, the buffs can be unwieldy: while the Dido+3HMS requirements is easily filled and so is taking the chimpanQE along, exploiting the Dido-class buff will result in at least *someone* not getting to use part of their kit (Dido would want QE, Sirius wants carriers, Black Prince wants 1 USS unit). You have options with Dido, but trying to fit all in isn't one of them... if you lack Muse Dido, that is.

Sameness aside, Mido will behave more or less like the regular one does save for the extra barrage and a greater focus on AA; a welcome addition, considering these so-called AA cruisers have proven more adept at shooting up ships than simply shooting up (not that's a bad thing, but still).  
Slightly better as a standalone unit, slightly worse in terms of Dido-class support. Use both Dido together and enjoy the best of both worlds.

>Edinburgh is in a similar situation as Cleveland: both have merely 'okay' skills, both have impressive statlines, both will stay in front and tank for days while the rest of the team gets the job done.  
The difference lies in how 'safe' they play things, as Edinburgh gets a passive boost to AP damage inflicted, an even bulkier HP pool (4.1k is amazing for both varieties of Cruiser) and no AA skill to burn her FP, but doesn't get that lone shot at the fleetwide buff and her DPS is still par for the course for a CL.  
Still, there's very few more reliable frontline tanks than she - and that's a definite plus.

- Desc: what if black prince but good
>A fairly standard Dido-class CL, she comes with the expected solid-but-unremarkable DD gun DPS, passable AA and atrocious torpedoes.  
As a Dido-class, the barrages should be the main attraction here... except they're implemented in just about the stupidest way possible: the arcing, short-range barrage only fires when she's 30+ units away from any enemy, meaning she has to gingerly skirt the edge of the 30-35 units mark for it to fire (no guarantee of it landing on target either), whereas the non-conditional one just fires straight... which doesn't mesh with the supposed aiming on the arcing barrage.  
It's a mess, but if you actually do jump through the hoops she forces you to, the damage *is* there and it's *mostly* worth it.

>Hey you! Yes, you! Did you ever wonder how much easier would clearing mobs be if you could just reduce the Out of Ammo debuff, maybe by taking one ship that could do it?  
No? Well me neither, but there she is anyway.  
To be clear, Gloucester isn't a bad CL: she's on par with your average HMS CL, in fact, which is a fairly good place to be in, and taking her will not hamper your progress... however, the usefulness of that skill is a matter of fierce debate.
As the common method of dealing with the Out of Ammo thing is to have a comp capable of handling those multiple fights, usually reliant on healing of some sort, in order not to take casualties and potentially reduce overall costs; Gloucester's skill grows 'stronger' the more units you take, however, which is something you'd rather avoid in a mob fleet because the costs would increase.  
She's in a weird position, all in all, and whether you'll take her or not will most likely depend on whether you find her skill useful; she's good enough to pull her own weight, either way, and that's good enough.

Armed with an excellent AP barrage and a very powerful AP boosting passive, and protected by a very large HP pool for her weight class plus a stronger version of Phoenix's self-rescue skill, Neptune is perfectly capable of tanking just as well as her colleague but (given manual usage) also of ending the fights much faster, due to her quite considerable damage output.

* Desc: The advent of Plane Hells earned this previously inferior version of Leander a spot on the Tier Guide, as she patches the glaring AA-shaped hole in the HMS vanguard lineup. Her skillset isn't particularly remarkable and focusing on gunnery as a Torp-CL is somewhat questionable, but she does the job legitimately well - especially with planes to shoot at.

* Desc:
>The other HMS answer to Phoenix, and... just as the other (Neptune), unable to truly upstage her despite being pretty okay.  
What makes Phoenix so desirable is a combination of extreme reliability (all-gun setup), solid statline and low costs; Penelope loses that reliability by taking torpedoes, hindering her already lacking Torp-CL clearing power, resulting in more frequent occurrences of ramming enemies and taking severe damage in the process.  
This is less of a concern on manual play, naturally, and on the bright side the self-heal comes with a considerable temporary damage reduction; this may come in handy should she be exposed to particularly heavy burst damage (or ramming things).  
Remember that boosting her torpedoes with Oxytorps will cut into her survivability, so handle with care.

* Desc: Not 2B taken lightly.
>Similar in a few ways to Jintsuu, Sirius offers a spectacular buff to a specific subset of units while benefiting greatly from it herself - significant enough to offset her otherwise unimpressive statline and really get the most out of her DD guns.
Gunnery is her main asset, and her barrage even more so - one of the absolute best as far as vanguards are concerned, very quick and hard-hitting despite the unassuming Normal shells, and unique in its narrowing pattern, which makes landing most of the shots from long range a rather simple task.  
That said, you will need to deploy a few carriers to get the full experience and with her barrage making up a significant portion of her overall DPS, her auto performance will suffer - handle with care.

>Isuzu's retrofit went a long way towards cementing her position as the strongest solo AA powerhouse in the game, while also bolstering her thin hull - and giving her something to do when her monstrous AA isn't actually needed, in the form of some sizeable buffs to weapon efficiencies and some free torpedoes.  
The 'assault mode' she goes into when taking non-IJN guns raises her DPS to fairly respectable levels, roughly on par with your average HMS CL, while also bringing down her AA to less obscene levels (which are still considerably higher than most of the competition's).  
That said, Isuzu Kai's main calling is that of the AA monster; it's nice you can now use her outside of that one role, but you have better DPS options. Consider her if you need significant AA on top of some DPS.

About the only flaw she has, if we're feeling nitpicky, is not being as helpful to gun-heavy comps as some other cruisers, but... for everyone else that does happen to have torpedoes, you'll want her specifically.

Make no mistake, she can hold her ground and all but 2 of the RNG Fiesta's outcomes are desirable (namely the two heals, one intentionally meant to be bad and one that is bad merely because Yuubari has barely more HP than the average DD without their Evasion), but the complete inability to control the results makes her a tough sell for anyone but the most compulsive gamblers - or the most squeamish about oil costs (8 Oil at MLB).

> Clearly inspired by the popular and very capable Zara, this former Admiral Hipper hull does away with the predecessor's CA guns and revolving shields in favour of more CL guns and the much superior single front-facing style of hitshields... which, uniquely, also happen to shoot back as they are inevitably broken. While frailer than Zara's and slower to respawn, by virtue of triggering a barrage when broken they are also more universally useful: hitshields have a deservedly poor reputation for breaking far too quickly to incoming enemy fire that would have dealt little to no damage anyway, and this provides an elegant solution to the issue.  
Shielding aside, Mainz shows some versatility in use, gaining more bulk and speed if set as vanguard lead or more damage output if placed elsewhere; given how ubiquitous CL or CA tanks are (and how rare Gun-CL capable of actual DPS are), it would be better to have her off-tank and let her rip.

Jeanne d'Arc one-ups Sheffield in the 'vanguard protector' role, as her shields apply to every ship regardless of HP and are proper shields instead of a damage reduction, meaning at least some damage will be blocked entirely; better yet, if the personal shields were to break (as they are wont do during enemy bursts), the subsequent 2s of invulnerability let those units evade even more damage.  
The heal on shield expiration is nice too, but hardly going to make a difference later on (they'll just break first, but DDs could still appreciate the help when the pressure is lower); the +HMS damage is a funny historical reference and about as relevant as the damage she takes from her immolation (a meagre 80 damage after 30s of battle, entirely negligible).

>The first Regia Marina CL released hits the ground not just running, but sprinting like an Olympic athlete and leaving all her competitors in the dust.  
Whether it's defence (second largest HP pool among CLs, PRs aside; hefty and lengthy Evasion boost, AP and torpedo damage reductions; self-heal) or offence (quickload, straight up devastating torpedoes, extra barrage on torp launch), Duca degli Abruzzi is easily a match for the most biased IJN CLs out there as well as a priviledged partner of theirs.  
It's worth mentioning how the -1 Torpedo Speed is a very good thing, despite what it sounds like - torpedoes on manual tend to either be shotgunned or launched at relatively close range if HMS, and as such they are not negatively impacted, whereas torpedoes on auto more or less have to use KMS launchers to compensate for the AI's idiocy, at which point the slowdown considerably increases their hitrate by being unable to zoom past things.

Her buff is the absolute best in the entire game, no exception allowed; she gets MGM+1 while keeping her torps, a rarity only six other ships have access to; and her Armour is Medium, letting her outlast a good number of her competitors.  
As amazing as all this sounds, she is let down by one glaring flaw - her abysmal offensive statline, which even her impressive buff struggles to shore up, compounded with pre-WW1-era engines that grant her the questionable honour of being the slowest ship in the game (tied with Yat Sen).  
All that said, unlike Yat Sen she is certainly usable; okay-ish on her own and an amazing force multiplier, having her around won't cut into your DPS to the point of crippling your fleet and will help your other ships MvP.

The Ignitions are the same as her regular Ignitions, and therefore risk being overridden by stronger ones; still, free damage is free damage for as long as it lasts.

Nothing about these three looks usable, until you start deploying them together - at which point the sisters start evading better than basically anyone else in the game, even on the Single Line formation, achieveing unrivaled amounts of effective HP while dishing out respectable DPS besides.  
Lots of investment needed and Yat Sen MUST be protected at all costs (hint, place her between Ping and Ning), but they're the ultimate stonewall - if that's what you're looking for, it's worth it.

>Another excellent showing from the Baltimore-class, Bremerton brings impressive amounts of AA fire from a Heavy Cruiser without compromising staying power or damage output in the process.  
Sharing the same high-end gunship CA statline of her sister Baltimore (with the notable exception of the enhanced AA, a staggering 140% Efficiency), Bremerton can roughly dish out and take the same punishment of her sibling - with the crucial difference that Bremerton may mount either HE or AP guns and have her damage boost fill the gap between the two's anti-Medium performance, whereas Baltimore is locked into AP shelling.  
Depending on where you place her, Bremerton can either be a vanguard tank or a light AA carry; in all likelihood she'll be fulfilling the former role until W12+, where the heavy plane presence and tough enemies warrant both her firepower and AA.
One last note - despite what her skill description says, the special barrage DOES NOT ignite targets. No biggie, the damage would've been minimal anyway, but unfortunate.

What issues she does have are fairly minor: she needs to proc to get tough, obviously, but her uptime is high and she has two chances to proc per firing cycle; and her damage output isn't as high as it could be, since her only skill is that Evasion buff, but it's still higher than most non-CA (and many Torp-CA) frontliners manage.

Out of the three modes, the ones most likely to see use are the DPS-rear or the Tank-front; the former for self-explanatory reasons, as she's already strong and gets much stronger as she settles in the back, and the latter because her survivability skyrockets past even some of the toughest tanks around (to the point it is kind of excessive most of the time).

Whereas San Diego shreds Light Armour better, Cheshire takes over against other types; and where San Diego's supportive capabilities come mainly in the form of a massive fleetwide AA buff, Cheshire's more or less boils down to taking lots of hits and chugging along regardless, helped in that by the Medium armour and the +Eva stacks.

Her ghost guns get a buff too; welcome, but they don't really get to the point where they pose a significant threat.

While her base form has never been bad, performing as well as a Leander Kai at the end of the day, her comparatively high costs and mostly irrelevant niche (buffing DD FP as well as the rest) meant she wouldn't see much use; the Kai does not change this, but it does put her DPS in the big leagues thanks to her new obscenely powerful DD mount and chance for double damage, while the stat gains make her considerably tougher beside; the +Acc stacks are nice but not particularly important as vanguards don't really struggle landing hits but more crits are appreciated nonetheless.

>At long last, here is the "frontline BB" the playerbase has dreamed of for ages, and how closely does she match that moniker!  
Close in firing mechanics, damage output, bulk and price tag - a staggering *16 oil* - to a proper battlecruiser, Azuma is at her best in lategame engagements, where her AoE-capable guns and barrage are able to shoot over the uncomfortably common shields from a distance and smash the clusters of tightly-packed mobs as she weathers almost effortlessly the incoming hailstorm of bullets thanks to her Heavy Armour (if she's wielding the VH Plate, that is).  
That said, don't make the mistake of thinking Heavy Armour makes her invincible - while regular gunfire will now only scratch some paint off of her, torpedoes and aerial ordnance are now much more lethal threats you will have to manoeuvre out of the way of (or have tanked by someone slimmer), lest you see your precious 'frontline battleship' meet the same fate enemy Kongous usually do.

- Desc: What do you mean "she's not a DD"?
> Someone at the design bureau must've missed a memo when they designed Ibuki.  
Sporting an IJN DD's skillset and an IJN CA's statline, by all rights she should be a failure on both accounts - but against all odds, she ends up taking both's best attributes and only few of the flaws.  
Her IJN DD side shines through her double preloaded torpedo spreads, the ludicrous 185% Torpedo Efficiency and entirely Torpedo-focused skills (including, if Fated, a neat +Eva buff on torpedo launch); her IJN CA side comes to the fore during the lulls inbetween torpedo strikes, as she falls back on her remarkable Torp-CA gunnery and sturdy frame to keep up the offensive.  
That said, however, she's much more of a DD than a CA - to perform at her best she needs Oxygen Torpedoes, which limit her survivability (in comparison to other CAs at least, she's still considerably tougher than most IJN DDs), as well as suitable targets, which restricts her use cases to Sirens and bosses or alternatively particularly menacing mobs.
Still, as long as you employ her for the surgical strikes she's made for, she has little to no rivals in her field.

Being an IJN CA, this means she gets a much better torp suite than her not-IJN peers and CL-like speed to go with the solid gunnery (mostly because of her 30% chance for double fire); a good deal, if for some reason you think you need a Torp-CA and a tough hull to go along with it (courtesy of the Takao-class specific EvaRate boost upon first barrage).

Blessed with one of the best vanguard barrages currently available once upgraded, and bolstered by buffs that naturally improve both her ability to barrage and the barrage itself, she's uniquely positioned to take advantage of an otherwise ignored feature of this class without sacrificing actual gunnery in the process.  
And speaking of gunnery, the addition of the Seattle Gun - the only CL gun able to match CA gunnery on a relatively even footing and the only real choice for CL gunnery on boss fleets - makes Suzuya suddenly a lot more viable, capable as she is of maximising its effectiveness with her CA FP, relatively high efficiency and barraging a lot more, given the improved volume of fire.
On the flipside, said barrage is also her most noteworthy feature - manual play is almost mandatory in order to play to her strength.

> Prinz Heinrich is what Deutschland and Spee would've looked like had they been designed properly, and represents a massive improvement over either in every possible respect; superb staying power, extremely competitive damage output that allows her to not only match but also outgun proper Gun-CA without banking excessively on her (comparatively decent) torpedoes, and access to the same SKC28 of old, for which her 7s cooldown damage boost appears to be designed (but don't stress too much about it, even if you go for faster guns with more appropriate modifiers you'll be gaining more than you lose overall).  
Something to bear in mind is that, more than most Torp-CA, she is capable of handling shields; while torpedoes do slip past them, the SKC28 can shoot over them and her 20s barrage has a very high shot count, capable of punching straight through most of them (assuming the barrage lands, at least, which isn't unlikely given its tight and clustered pattern).

> Saint Louis and Roon apparently stand at opposite ends.  
Whereas the former starts out strong and lose some of her lustre as the battle drags on, the latter needs time to wind up; where the former's barrage is uncomfortably wide, the latter's is very concentrated and devastating; where the former relies on high speed and evasion to stay out of harm's way, the latter simply adds layers of HP and shields to power through the barrages; and as the former gradually mellows out of her cold templar persona, the latter grows ever more violent and unhinged.  
Had that been it, they would've made for a roughly equivalent pair; but as it stands, she is saddled with a detrimental ammo swap mechanic that prevents her from fully harnessing her power and a shield skill that is only marginally better than Prinz's by virtue of being a guaranteed proc (and the least said about the Dev35 buff it enjoys, ie. having them spawn at the start of the fight, the better).

As hilariously superior as Moon is, one thing has not changed, namely the reliance on manual play: the red shields don't orbit far and the new barrages are still linear, so she'll risk wasting significant chunks of DPS if auto is at the helm (especially when it comes to aforementioned barrages).

Mightiest of all CA by weight of stats and skills, there is no area where she doesn't excel - her guns absolutely melt opposing Light Armour and punch through Heavy Armour better than most other frontliners' in the game, her Speed is slightly superior to that of CLs and enjoys a hefty boost to her already high Evasion for more than half a minute after the battle starts, her AA is uncharacteristically high for her class and she enjoys all the perks of her Spe-CA peers (Medium Armour, MGM+1 and Torpedoes).  
The only fault one can find in her would be her barrage - its wide linear pattern helps dispatching multiple weak foes, yes, but also neuters its impact against single targets.

Algérie rectifies this unfortunate situation by, amusingly, leaning more into the gun side of her kit - her shelling, aided by the barrage, is strong enough to be somewhat competitive with dedicated Gun-CAs, while her torpedoes are well-capable of taking out hard targets (BB in primis).  
Her staying power is also impressive, in part because of the excellent statline, in part because of the +Evasion, and in part because of the anti-torpedo shield (which counterintuitively you want to *keep safe*, as it increases her damage output).

That is not to say she is frail, of course: she sports Zara's high eHP and bolsters it further with the 45s Eva boost as well as the damage reduction, but as Zara's shielding hinges on her taking hits, it is clear whose job it is to tank and whose to off-tank.

Portland Kai may be cheap, Prinz Eugen may have more eHP and Moon may have more DPS,  but none of them have her spectacular shields nor her combination of good DPS and high eHP at the same time, and that's what pushes her above her competitors.    
While the damage boosts are undoubtedly good and allow her to perform optimally under every circumstance, the shields are the real stars of the show here - not only their uptime is much higher than the 18% would lead you to believe, able as they are to proc on *any* attack that collides with her chibi (even if she evades the damage), the front-facing shield is absolutely invaluable when it comes to blocking incoming enemy fire entirely, especially if it's piercing enemy fire.

In any case, Tallinn is exceptionally bulky, *even* by the lofty standards of tank CAs, courtesy of her double layer of shields; hitshield first, then hpshield second, and a nice aimed barrage in-between for some extra firepower as the hitshield inevitably breaks. Just as well, since despite her above average damage output, a Torp-CA's a Torp-CA (with poor torpedoes to boot) and volume of fire will be sorely lacking no matter what.

A strong statline allows her to capitalise well on said buffs, although the +Acc is by most indications the useless roll and the heal loses value if she is not damaged (and if she is, it does not compete with real heals).

  * Gain a persistent stack of +2.5% FP per enemy node destroyed, and gain a temporary stack +2.5% FP per enemy destroyed in battle (up to a cap of 17.5%, meaning that Alabama starts with more stacks the more nodes she fights but still can't go past +17.5%); also, after the 5th destroyed node, the backline takes -8% damage.

>Meant to take centre place in mob fleets, owing to her strong set of self-buffs that ramp over the course of multiple engagements and a minor but nice backline protection past the fifth fight, Alabama is both strong and reliable.
While she can work on boss fleets, so long as she gets some kills before it spawns and nobody else wants the flag slot, she's better off playing to her strengths.  
Also, a W13 tip - her barrage is AP, focused and linear. This means it can be expected to take on those pesky Command Craft and blow them up reliably, all you have to do is place her in the top position.

>Georgia is a simple woman - she sees a big gun, she barrages.  
There's really not much to say about her. Very straightforward USS BB, sporting the characteristically excellent AA of her peers, albeit improved, and their same DD guns; her most remarkable feature the fact her barrage is both absolute murder *and* partially aimed, meaning it can be used from the sidelines with just a minor loss in performance, as well as her lacking one Main Gun Mount (which is partially made up for by the high Main Gun Efficiency, and partially by the devastating barrage).  
That said, while the SHS shots are the ones that'll be most relevant to you, the DD HE shower is no joke and shouldn't be discounted, especially when you need to bring all the guns to bear and/or the boss has Light Armour; bear in mind that zippier bosses may need some slowing down for the SHS to connect.

  * Main Gun damage increases by up to +15% the farther the target is; if mounting USS DD secondaries, Main Gun ammo is overrideen to SHS (60/135/115, shells fire at extremely high angles and fall from the sky) and the distance damage bonus increases to +30%. Do not give her USS DD secondaries.

* Desc: Massachusetts shoots for the stars, but the aim isn't quite there. 
>Once synonymous with 'atrocious aim', Massachussetts' enforced SHS ammo and its much reduced AoE (8 as opposed to the BB shell standard 15) rendered all but incapable of hitting anything moving faster than a rock, which squandered her otherwise remarkable statline and buffs.   
Well, no more of that now; so long as you do NOT give her a USS BB secondary (why would you anyway, 128SKC are better at interception), Massa still gets to enjoy a fairly meaty distance damage boost without torpedoeing her physical hit rate in the process.  
A very solid pick for USS fleets, all in all.

* Desc:
>A godsend for the lacklustre USS backline roster, New Jersey sets out to hardcarry the entire faction out of infamy and into the big leagues - and almost succeeds beautifully in that task.  
Not so much because the buffs she provides are especially notable, though they definitely are (especially for carriers, which she can help across fleets), or because she herself is horrifyingly powerful (she is THE strongest BB in the game, at the time of writing, and sporting a devastating debuffing displaced half-preloaded autocritting AND aimed barrage ON TOP of a statline only the notoriously expensive and hard to raise FdG can hope to match), but because of the versatility of her design and the smashing performaces she puts out on all counts.  
Is it finally time to run full USS fleets, then? Well, no, not really; she's devastating and she does God's work for her fellows, but alas, the rest of the roster does reman lacklustre (especially when it comes to CV, BB and DD) compared to other nations. Still, her conditions are easily satisfied, and setting her up with Helena for boss fleets is almost a no-brainer.

>Anti-air for backliners is a bit of a meme, but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one.  
North Carolina goes harder than anyone else on the AA front, as far as backliners are concerned - not only does she prevent plane damage with her skill, she also grows stronger the more AA she acquires (and she's plenty strong to begin with, sporting a very high base FP thanks to said skill).  
Whether you do actually need all that AA is another matter entirely, but rest assured that she will lay on the hurt even if you don't - and if you do, that's just gravy.

A slow ramp, sure, but better than nothing.  
Her double damage proc needs RNG to work, but when it does it'll let her deal significant damage.

Bear in mind that despite her having a barrage, she isn't *really* one - it's at best a little bit of extra utility and a smattering of free damage every 20s, its damage being too piddly (and the accuracy too poor) to really be considered.

The self-FP buffs are granted via easily achieved conditions, considering both Duke of York and Monarch are mainstays in most boss fleets anyway; worse comes to worst, there's no shortage of HMS units favouring having more HMS units around.

  * Deal +15% dmg to Sirens.
  
- Desc: 
>It'd be easy to regard Monarch as a straight upgrade to Hood - and for the most part, she kind of is.
She mounts CL guns (for a greater FP boost and better anti-fireship prowess), her FP and Efficiencies are much better, her barrage is AP (great for handling lategame priority targets and bosses) and she can even heal herself, extending her operational time well beyond that of her 'predecessor' while gaining Reload for every % of missing HP... what more could one possibly want from a battleship?  
Not a whole lot, all in all, but one would best remember that both AA and Armour Modifiers are something to take into account: while Monarch will indeed mop the floor with light and hard targets alike, Hood does still possess a superior rate of fire married to a Reload-boosting powerful barrage, both helpful things to have during mob fleet engagements (as well as the Normal BB ammo mods) where sheer, brutal damage output may bot be the best course of action at any time.  
In short, have Monarch handle Medium/Heavy bosses while Hood (or someone else) handles the mobs; you'll be glad you did, when her AP deluge, 145% Efficiency main guns and mounting Reload all spell doom to your unfortunate opponent.

>Well, the Kai's come and gone, and Warspite's left in a slightly better position than she originally was - as far as PvE is concerned, at least.  
While her statline did enjoy a substantial offensive boost in the form of more stats, chief among which her absurd 100 Accuracy (roughly a fourth more than of most BBs), higher Efficiencies and a strong passive skill, her new-and-improved barrage suffers from the same unreliability that torpedoed her shot(s) at glory - as powerful as those AP shells now are, they're still all too likely to be fired at Light targets (or worse, at fireboats), while the marker part of barrage appears to be bafflingly ineffectual, as evidenced both by *HMS BB/C still opening fire on unmarked targets* and by the possibility of *multiple markers coexisting, negating the supposed benefits*.  
On the bright side, Warspite's newfound strength lets her be competitive there once more in the PvP areans, where her intended targets are always armoured, immobile and valuable.

* Desc: Takes a King to put an upstart Prince in its place.
>Heh, typical nobles. Profiting from their underlings and giving next to nothing in return.  
While KGV is yet another sovereign that doesn't buff back her fellow countrywomen, there's no denying the buff she receives from them is both quite simple to attain (the HMS is spoiled for good backline choices) and substantial; not only that, her damage buff is hardly ever out of a job considering 99% of the enemies in PvE are IJN.  
As for the 356mm, long story short - it only overtakes the good ol' 406MK6 if her first volley lands most of its shots and hits something valuable, otherwise the long cooldown and the subpar damage eventually catch up to her; it won't cripple her but she won't benefit a whole lot from it either, and her barrage is fairly anaemic anyway so buffing it isn't too desirable a prospect.  
In short, she's a big burly beatstick that'll benefit from having some HMS cheerleaders around. Only let her be the flag if nobody else has a better barrage.

She remains a very simple unit overall, almost-preload aside (which can become a full preload if you give her a HPFCR, French-style); stick her in with USS units, preferably cruisers and carriers (feel free to use BBs instead though) and let her work her magic, buffing herself and her colonial buddies all the while.

>The IJN's take on USS BB, and courtesy of the renowed IJN Bias(tm), she's far stronger than her competition - both in terms of actual battleship prowess, thanks to a very solid barrage and high-end BB statline, and more damningly in terms of AA support, bolstered for herself and her fellows by a +15% stat boost.

If it weren't for the gimmick attached to her powerful main barrage, Tosa would be yet another competent but unremarkable BBarrager, hampered by a near-total lack of supportive capabilities; however, through the wonders of IJN magicks, that barrage holds the unique ability to fire from the flagship slot regardless of whether she's actually in there or not, a massive boon for every BBarrager as that's where barrages deal the most damage.  
While Tosa has two more barrages, as mentioned, only the main one is worth much credit. The proximity barrage, while alright and decent enough at putting some fire downrange, needs her to be the flagship to make the most of it (which goes against her role as off-flag BBarrager) and the support barrage is so pitifully weak and limited it's simply better to pretend it doesn't exist at all.

Positively brimming in buffs for herself as well as her countrywomen, her sole presence is enough to kick all their weaponry into overdrive, having them shoot harder and slightly faster, while their carriers (all one/two of them) enjoy a sizeable damage injection and Tirpitz finally overcomes her social anxiety with oneesan around and becomes actually useful.
Her own guns are no strangers to buffs either, with guaranteed crits on every first salvo of every volley and massively extended CL secondary ranges (at the cost of 1/3 less damage); the former buff easily steals the spotlight, but the range extension allows her to lend a hand to a vanguard that's in over its head (or take potshots at vanguards in PvP). Do not expect it to help an actually competent vanguard however... or to stop *anything* at all once the zero ammo kicks in, as those guns will be firing at -85% damage.
Last and least, she has a barrage too. It has the unique distinction of being so bad it's not worth even taking into consideration when picking gear.

What, you want more? Fine. Freddy Mercury is unreasonably strong, fully deserving of her status as a DR (and the disgusting ***19*** Oil cost) brimming as she in the sheer staying power granted by her escalating defence buff and nearly 10k base HP as well as firepower, courtesy of the devastating 160% Main Gun Efficiency she gets without sacrificing gun mounts or an easily-procced, powerful defensive barrage.  
If one were to look hard for any chinks in her Plot Armour it could be said that her HitRate is abysmal, not that BBs exactly shine in that regard; nevertheless she's uncharacteristically bad in that regard, suffering from the PR standard 0 Luck and a meagre 65 Accuracy, but it's an easily solved issue anyway.

>One of the most consistent and hardest hitting BBs in the game, provided you cater to her social anxiety.  
While not as flashy as her competition, Tirpitz is, in a way, the "safe" choice - her abilities can't misfire, her defensive statlines makes her tougher than most and her damage buff extends to both her CL guns and torpedo spread, ensuring that even at 0 Ammo she will still be able to strike and defend herself with remarkable effectiveness.
However, all this becomes quickly irrelevant as soon as she loses her +30% damage buff as it the main reason behind her power; without it she has very little reason to be used and will be easily outshone by pretty much everyone.

>Ever wanted a fourth vanguard ship but the game just won't let you stick in more? Like Bismarck's secondary memes but are sad at how useless (when not outright detrimental) they are? Is just one flagship not enough for you? Odin's got you covered.  
A very unique unit, Odin takes after Bismarck and Tirpitz and upstages both at their own games... by providing solid protection for your beleaguered vanguard both in the form of a nifty defence boost and a constant hail of gunfire that IS capable of shooting past the white pushback line, and significant fire support in the form of surprisingly capable long-range torpedo mounts you can call in like a normal torp spread and a nasty timed barrage.  
The secondaries deserve further elaboration. As mentioned, Odin mounts two sets of them on top of the torpedoes; one pair behaves like many twin DD guns with significantly increased damage, universal armour modifiers (100/100/100) and extremely long range (ie. they reach past the white pushback line, unlike Bismarck's, thanks to extra range on their part and Odin being positioned closer to the edge of the screen), one's meant for self-defence against the fireships Bismarck struggles to intercept, leaving her always capable of responding to incoming threats.  
It is important to remember that the former set makes up for about 1/3rd of her overall DPS, and if it is not allowed to operate (as would happen with far away bosses or enemies), her contribution to the fight would suffer considerably.

>A very peculiar creature, at first glance it's hard to tell what Champagne is supposed to do: while her main gun (singular, it's important) reloads very quickly, it alone is not quite enough to oneshot the harder chibis; she has a defensive skill aimed at a flagship, but her DD AP bursts seem to suggest she's meant for flagship duties herself.  
As it stands, Champagne shines the brightest as a sort of flagship fire support, and even more so in a French roster that severely lacks sources of AP damage output; whether she fires first or second, her single shots are devastating and entirely capable of severely weakening targets left alive by others' barrages or softening them up enough for someone else to sweep them up, and in the meantime she gets to take the edge off of the return fire.  
That's not to say she cannot be used as a flagship, of course, the DD AP bursts are fairly damaging in her own right... but whether she is the best fit for the job depends entirely on whether her main gun *can* or *cannot* snipe off the map enemy chibis. 
If she can, perfect; if not, consider looking elsewhere.

>As befitting a mecha musume, Gascogne is shockingly efficient and stable - and it's not even entirely the heal's doing.  
No, while the heal (and the defensive buff it comes stock with) are definitely very appreciated, the real stars of the show here are both the guaranteed barrage fired every 20s and the way in which her main guns fire, ensuring that every shell will land on priority target no matter how fast it moves.  
These are all very desirable characteristics for a mob fleet flagships, but don't forget that her gunnery is more than good enough to earn her a place in a boss fleet as well if need be - an effective 220%+ Efficiency is horrifyingly devastating, all you have to do is take the shot yourself.  
If all this sounds like perfection for a newer player who would just love a strong battleship that is certain to shell what needs shelling and not whiff barrages, it's because she is - but a newer player would never be able to unlock her until this amazing kit loses its lustre, since KMS backliners are hard to come by.

Volume of fire is ultimately maintained by her gun, firing a respectable 8 shots in total, and cooldowns aren't a concern either thanks to her higher-than-normal Reload; whatever she's facing, it's heading straight to Davy Jones' locker.

>Giulio Cesare's status as a WW1-era dreadnought is made very apparent by her lacking statline, as well as the hilarious amount of shots the puts out when barraging; and while they are solid shots, by most indications, they're still tied to a coinflip you'd rather not make if you could help it.  
Still, she's an alright BB and well suited to dispatching the very common CL hull class.

* Skill:
  * On main gun fire, 65% chance to launch a barrage; if mounting the Triple 381mm Main Gun (M1934), aka Littorio Gun, gain +10% proc chance and improve the [barrage](http://p5.qhimg.com/t0125ee7f86d5827577.gif).
    * The 6/9 SHELLS deal 174 bdmg with 40/125/125 mods; the 20 NEEDLE LASERS deal 20 bdmg with 120/60/60 mods. The damage of both is modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * Upon battle start, generate 2 anti-torp shields in front of Littorio and the vanguard lead, each able to tank up to 2 hits; also, gain +20% FP for the first 3 battles in a sortie.

- Desc: 
>Azur Lane's Littorio doesn't quite match her historical acclaim as one of the best warships of her time but she's still very good, especially as a mauler of lategame Medium/Heavy Armour formations.  
Blessed with an overall very good statline (Accuracy aside), a strong AP barrage and a hefty FP buff for the first three fights in a sortie, Littorio looks similar enough to Alabama but approaches mobbing in a different way - whereas Alabama gets stronger with each fight and therefore benefits from chewing up easier nodes first, Littorio wants to demolish the toughest opposition first and then move onto easier stuff.  
The anti-torp shields are nice enough too, but not much of a gamechanger considering her job description - speaking of which, unlike Alabama you *could* use her as a boss fleet flag without throwing away part of her skillset, but the less concentrated barrage means she's at her best whem she's fighting more mobile Medium/Heavy bosses who may or may not have adds too.  
*About her gun...* it's an interesting piece of kit, with its +10% Damage for the first two volleys, but it only really works on Littorio or when hunting Sirens (assuming you don't have BB with preloaded/accelerated volleys).

  * If sortied with 2+ RN units or when equipping an AP main gun, gain +12% FP; also, her fleet takes -20% torp damage for the first three battles.

- Desc: It's Veneto, VENETO.
>*Five main guns and a half holy meatballs what is this.*  
Positively brimming in GUN and Regia Marina buffs, Vittorio Veneto is the flagship every fleet deserves: generous with her allies, a nightmare to her foes, and courteous enough to let her showboat of a sister sit in the flagship slot to do her job as BBarrager while she backs her up with her own aimed BBarrage.  
Do not be discouraged by the wealth of RN-only buffs, as VV is more than strong enough (and the skills' conditions lenient enough) to earn herself a spot in most fleets; on the other hand, while the damage resistance debuff on barrage whiff is great, you shouldn't expect it to happen and much less that it can replace Duke of York's own.

  * Once per fight when this unit's HP falls below 30%, reduce the damage taken by Gangut by -15% and allied DDs by -10%.

* Desc: Old but still RED gold.
>A true veteran of the Russian Revolution, Gangut - Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya, if you will - is an old WW1-era dreadnought come to rekindle the flames of the revolution in the bosoms of her fellow contrywomen, and does it ever show!  
Her rigging is severely outdated and her statline makes it blindingly obvious, as she has the dubious distinction of being by far the weakest proper big gun in the entire game; but she does manage to pull through by virtue of the ludicrous buffs she heaps upon her unique and historical gun, to the point of actually outgunning even some WW2-era hard hitters like Tirpitz, while buffing her comrades in the process... at least as long as the four salvo last (she runs dry at about the 70s mark).
As such, despite her comparatively frail constitution and otherwise pathetic statline, Gangut manages to make for both an excellent warship in her own right and a great faction buffer.  
Just don't ask her to handle boss fights if you can help it, and if you do, make sure it's against a DD/CL; she can't afford to swap guns and her DD escort is meant to take on those anyway.

    * The 14 ICEBERGS deal 164 bdmg with 90/100/110 mods and inflict -40% Speed *and* a very minor 2x23 Flood DoT, 4s long. The damage of all of these is modified by 100% of the unit's FP, except for the Flood (no scaling).
  * If above 60% HP, gain +20% FP and reduce Ignition durations on herself by -3s; if below 50% HP and twice per battle, self-heal by 12% of max HP over 8s. From the 2nd fight and onward, vanguard units take -8% damage.

- Desc: 
>Northern Parliament units have a reputation for being tough customers. While that is not quite the case, barring some exceptions such as Tashkent (relatively speaking) and Tallinn, Belorussiya sets out to singlehandedly justify the rumours by sporting a downright impressive defensive tooklit: Ignitons last less so long as she's above 60% HP, her AA kicks into high gear if her barrage fails to proc (won't be shooting down much, like most BBs out there, but it'll let her tank planes better), and of course she gets to heal 12% of her max HP back if hit when below 50% HP... *twice* per battle; and since she's got more where all that came from, her vanguards also get to enjoy a -8% damage taken buff from the second fight onward.  
Offensively she's not quite as remarkable; while armed with above-average guns and a hefty +20% FP (so long as she's above 60% HP), her barrage's good against clustered mob waves more so than single targets, cementing her role as main moBBer.  
If you're looking for a flagship that just won't die, look no further.

- Desc: 
>One of Wargaming's famed paper boats(tm), Sovetskaya Rossiya was historically inspired by Littorio's blueprints and her Azur Lane incarnation makes it blindingly obvious: both have very similar barrages (though Rossiya's also has the slowing icebergs falling in a checkers pattern), both have almost the same statline (though Rossiya has much worse Luck), both have a weird limited-time power-up (though Rossiya's lasts one battle less, affects Accuracy and requires three more Russians around).  
What does this mean in practice? It means that Rossiya is very comparable to Littorio overall but is slightly less flexible while being potentially a bit more powerful, so long as her conditions are met.

- Desc:
>Hailed as a modern day Arizona, she kind of fits the bill... if you don't stress the details too much.  
While she is indeed much stronger and better suited to moBBing duties by virtue of the oodles of barrages on demand (with the proc-on-fire one being the more relevant one), her healing capabilities are, for the most part, nothing worth writing home about *unless* you mean to sortie duo fleets.  
As it happens, duo fleets are a mainstay for farming, and thus Honoka finds herself fitting a valuable niche. Fortunate!

That aside, she's a very straightforward BB, and with the aimed nature of the barrage, one that may easily find employment in many fleets.

- Desc: An upgrade to Washington.
>Though she may not look much like the part, BB AI does live up to her title; between the very significant crit boost (for which the +1 scatter may as well not be there, insubstantial as it is), the hilariously scattershot but poweful barrage clearing the field for the Main Guns and access to CL defensive guns, there's very little not to like here.  
The Accuracy and Evasion boosts are nice to have, too, but not exactly worthy of prime time - especially as the +Acc ends up compensating for her lower-than-usual base stat.

* Skill: Every 20s, 60% chance to fire a special barrage.

- Desc: The poor man's Barrage Boat.
>A description partly in jest, and partly absolutely accurate - compared to a normal BB, they are incredibly frail (barely 3k HP with Light Armour) and considerably weaker (low FP, slightly lower Efficiency, one less salvo per volley), but they also cost a fraction than what they do and still get truly impressive barrages.  
How does this come together? As pint-sized discount-costed powerhouses for early world farming, that's how: while low, their Firepower is enough to stop fireboats in their tracks, and if given enough Evasion, they can be reliably expected to evade incoming BB salvo, prolonging their operational time much beyond what their abysmal statline would lead you to believe.  
Monitors can be expected to auto their way up to W8 or 9 with little resistance. Any further, though, and auto becomes almost impossible as enemies get more accurate, tougher and more powerful: the moment a BB opens up on them, they're already dead.

* Skill: 40% chance to fire a special barrage when firing main gun.

- Desc: Newbie traps.
>So you just started playing and found these two BBs. Their barrages fire lasers everywhere and melt mobs and they look pretty tough, so they've gotta be good, right?  
Well, no, not really. It'll be like that only early on, where enemies tend to fall to a stiff breeze anyway, but the moment they're faced by serious opposition and normal (eg. 1.5k / 2k HP per trash mob) HP pools, the weaknesses of said barrage quickly come to the fore: low proc rate, proc fixed to main gun fire (which means having to take faster and weaker guns to fish for said procs), super-wide pattern subject to massive scatter and unable to hit what's directly in front of them, poor armour modifiers and poor base damage.  
In short, their barrage is the only notable feature they have - and it's both unreliable and weak.  
Avoid.

>You know what was just said about Nelson and Rodney? Well, they're even worse, courtesy of their weaker statlines and lack of CL guns; as for Maryland's +Dmg on low HP, it goes without saying that if you're taking damage, you're in an undesirable situation to begin with.  
Outgunned, outskilled, outcosted. With no hyperbole, they ARE among the worst BBs in the game.

* Desc: 
>The only aviation battleship to improve in every possible respect after her Kai, the new-and-improved Hyuuga doesn't only sport the customary brutal firepower and enough Main Gun Efficiency to thorougly brutalize what she hits despite the loss of one gun mount, but also retains good self-defence capabilities with her protective barrage.   
The seaplanes are still middling at best, but you're paying no price for a BB with access to a screenclear - that's more than good enough.


   ![BBV](/Images-for-the-Guide/IseKaiChibi.png "Isekai") - **[IJN Ise Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ise#Retrofit)**
* Skill:

* Desc: 
>Still the more powerful yet less useful sibling, Ise Kai fully embraces her nature as an instrument of destruction by improving her airstrikes to the point of respectability.
Damage's still not on par with proper carriers, sure, but it's leagues better than what other BBVs gets in terms of both damage and cooldown - and the only thing better than a screenclear is a screenclear that can take out some enemies alongside the bullets.

* Desc: 
>So this was already mentioned in the BB section, but to reiterate - Yamashiro and Fusou really get the short end of the stick here.  
Their gains in term of Firepower and Efficiency are not only insufficient to properly compensate for the MGM-1 (loss of 1/3 salvo), they're vastly outgunned by their superior BBV brethren; and their special BBV skill is a Zuiun airstrike that falls well short of even weak CVL airstrikes.  
In short, they're by all accounts a downgrade over their BB forms. Avoid like the plague.

* Desc: 
>More independent than Independence and rolling in Hellcats, Bataan provides shocking amounts of DPS for her class and excellent support - be it air support with her F6F storms, fire support with their bombs and her own powerful torpedo bombers or support support with the Reload and AA buffs, Bataan has something to offer to every carrier comp out there and nothing short of hell to enemy airwings.

  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: USS, AUGmented.
>A very peculiar beast, this first USS sort-of-national-booster, but a very effective one nonetheless.  
While at first glance her skills may look like a schizophrenic mess, and to a certain extent they are, on closer inspection it's fairly easy to see what their intent is - boosting either dual battleship comps or full carrier ones as well as herself, in a remarkable display of versatility.  
You may have to rethink your fleet to accommodate her eccentricities, but she'll make sure it'll be worth it.

![CVL](/Images-for-the-Guide/CasablancaChibi.png "Casablanda") - **[USS Casablanca](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Casablanca)** 
* Role:

* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, 15% chance to instantly charge another one.
  * Upon battle start, grant +12% Aviation and +10% Reload to every CV/L in Casablanca's fleet and her first airstrike's cooldown is -25% shorter; also grants +8% Aviation and +8% Reload to every CV/L in the fleet Casablanca is NOT in.
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: Here's to you, CVs.
>A support carrier through and through, Casablanca's damage output may be somewhat limited but compensates for it with staggering amounts of utility.  
Whether it's the entirely unique carrier buff working across fleets, the more standard carrier buff for her own fleet, the relatively strong AA gun or the accelerated first airstrike, there's almost everything for everyone here - though she is definitely at her best when supporting carriers.

 ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/EssexChibi.png "Not Pola") - **[USS Essex](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Essex)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, launches a tight horizontal line of eight additional TBDs armed with parallel, Flooding-inflicting torps; also, deal +10% damage vs BBs.
  * Increases her own AA and Aviation by 5% for every USS CV/L in the fleet, and increases her own Aviation by 3% whenever her planes shoot down an enemy aircraft (to a maximum of +15% Aviation).
  * If the fleet contains 4 or more USS ships, the entire fleet has a 12% chance to reduce incoming aircraft torpedo and bomb damage to 1.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Boasting a statline rivaled only by that of Enterprise, graced by even more Efficient planes (especially her 140% Fighters), armed to the teeth with skills further boosting that statline, a squadron of DoT-inflicting torpedo bombers and a fleet-wide chance to outright negate incoming aircraft damage, she is meant to give even the Foxes (or W12's plane swarms) pause for thought - and manages to do so with gusto.  
What keeps her from true greatness is how strictly she enforces a specific compositon for your backline to make the most of her skills - US carriers only might not be a bad thing per se, but it severely limits your choices. Her second skill being susceptible to killsteals by allied carriers or AA, and her third skill being nigh-on useless when planes aren't involved, doesn't help matters either.  
All that said, when she's good, she's REALLY good.

>One of the best solo CV currently in the game, courtesy of her solid statline and a skill that can reliably lay the smackdown on waves and airwings alike - as well as provide some emergency damage absorption against incoming aircraft or even shelling.
It's not all bombs and sunshine, though - while her proc rate is high, she is nevertheless very reliant on that proc to perform and her generalist Efficiencies tend to blunt her effectiveness somewhat.

* Skill: 
  * Gains +15% Efficiency on a slot when using USS planes.

  * Enhances the TBF barrage (see above). So long as this unit is alive, grant +12% Aviation and +10% Reload to all CV/L in the fleet and accelerate this unit's first airstrike by 25%; also, grant +8% Aviation/Reload to carriers in other fleets (+4% in OpSi). Does NOT stack with Casablanca's own skill.
  * Has a 4/0/4 + AA loadout.

* Desc: 
>Now armed with 8 planes and retaining her AA guns, plus an improved barrage and enhanced support capabilities, here's little civil about this CVL.  
One wonders what USS CV have done wrong for deserving their fleets' CVLs outshining them at every turn, but it is what it is; for the record, even with the improved (parallel) barrage, bringing a Cleveland-class CL remains a somewhat iffy prospect as they're kind of lacking and Independence doesn't particularly need the help either.  
Likewise, do not feel forced to take a USS TB; the usual suspects (Tenzan, Ryusei, JU D4 and Wyverns) are still much superior options, +15% Efficiency be damned.

![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/IntrepidChibi.png "Intepid") - **[USS Intrepid](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Intrepid)**
* Role: 
  * ~~Disappointment~~ Mob/Boss anti-BB/CL heavy bomb DPS; flagship tank.
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike relolad, launch a [SB2C barrage](https://streamable.com/9nkbb); the bombs inflict Armour Break on struck BC/BB/BBV for 6s.
    * The 3 2000lb bombs deal 380 bdmg with 70/105/125 armour modifiers; the 6 500lb bombs deal 220 bdmg with 80/90/110 armour modifiers. Both are modified by 100% of Intrepid's Aviation stat.
  * On her 1st, 3rd and 5th battle of the sortie, gain +15% Aviation. On her 2nd, 4th and 6th battle of the sortie, take -12% dmg.
  * Once per battle and upon falling below 20% HP, take -25% dmg for 20s and reduce Ignition damage sustained to 0 for 30s.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Worst of the Essex-class by a fairly significant margin, Intrepid may not be weak in the conventional sense - her DPS is fine, assuming her bombs land where they can hurt - but her kit is all over the place and lacks any semblance of support beyond the fairly insubstantial Armour Break.
Half of her skills push her in the direction of a proper attack carrier, and the other half tries to force her in a position almost no carrier would ever want to be placed in, that of flagship - at best this robs you of a precious BBarrager slot, at worst this robs you of that slot, of secondary defensive guns *and* exposed her to significant danger.  
Her best skill, a strong SB2C 'barrage' (two weaker dive bombers behaving just like regular ones), is also needlessly janky - the planes launch as soon as an airstrike comes off cooldown, meaning they may very well launch to an empty sea and do nothing, waste their payloads on something that's already half-dead, or get shot apart by enemy AA in W13.  
A very confused creature. Not irredeemable, quite strong, but very unwieldy.

* Skill: 
  * Increases experience gained by CV by 15%
  * Increases Reload for CVL by 15%, does not stack with other command skills that have similar effect. 
  * Has a 6/2/0 loadout.

* Desc:
>Once considered a liability due to the much reviled F/F/B loadout and an exp boost as a primary skill, Langley Kai's fortunes changed drastically with the advent of Air Superiority mechanics; not only do those fighters contribute almost or over twice the amount other types of planes do, but they're also extraordinarily cost-effective as well as slightly more readily available than usual.
If stacking AS is what you need but you'd rather not focus on carriers, look no further.

  * Upon airstrike launch, grants +15% damage output to the vanguard for 8s.
  * Have a 2/6/0 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Identical in use to Saratoga, both her pre- and post-Kai version; the only difference is she doesn't get a Kai, on account of not being a loli.  

![CVL](/Images-for-the-Guide/RangerKaiChibi.png "USS Ranger Kai") - **[USS Ranger Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ranger)**
* Skill: 
  * 15% chance upon airstrike launch, next airstrike becomes available immediately.
  * 25% chance of inflicting double damage with airstrike.
  * Has a 0/6/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Also referred to as RNGer for obvious reasons, and infamous because of her potentially infinite damage, you need luck on your side to get the most out of her; even without the procs, though, very few carriers get close to the sheer damage output she can unleash thanks to her 8 sea-attacking planes and high Efficiencies, and none of them can manage it at her rock-bottom 9 Oil cost.  
Beware her near-total lack of anti-air presence, though; without Fighters or AA guns to speak of, there's little she can do about enemy planes.

![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/SaratogaKaiChibi.png "Saratoga Kai") - **[USS Saratoga Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Saratoga#retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * Every 10s, fires a 3x2-bullet HE salvo (dmg scales with Aviation).
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants +15% damage output to the vanguard for 8s.
  * Upon airstrike launch, 70% chance to deploy 3 aimed torps inflicting Ignition and Flooding from three planes.
  * Has a 2/6/0 loadout.
  
* Desc: Puella Magi Toga Magica.
>Saratoga's Kai doesn't significantly change her playstyle: she's still the powerful DB-focused CV she's always been, but with a considerably improved statline that further emphasises her strengths. Extremely solid, even from a HP standpoint.  
Her Kai skill, just like her gunfire skill, is best regarded as a bit of free additional damage than a reliable contribution to the fight - the extra planes have aimed torpedoes and the DoTs they inflict are fairly weak, but it's still better than most CV do in their downtime.
 
![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/Shangri-LaChibi.png "Shangri-la") - **[USS Shangri-La](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shangri-La)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, 80% chance to scramble a 'B-25' and drop 12 extra bombs.
  * 10s after battle start, launch a F6F fighter and if it is shot down, scramble that same 'B-25'; also, every 8s after launching the fighter, gain a stack of +3% Accuracy and +7% Damage up to a maximum of 5 stacks.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: Creepy Bomber Lady.
>The Essex-class continues to impress, this time with a new-and-improved Hornet that manages to completely obsolete her predecessor while upstaging Enterprise in terms of reliability and overall performance (despite not quite hitting the same damage spikes a x2 dmg proc allows her).  
The F6F-induced barrage won't see usage in PvE, but never fear - the stacking buffs will, and they'll be signficant.
On a side-note, that's a B-17's shadow and not a B-25's. Irritating.
 
![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/TiconderogaChibi.png "Tico") - **[USS Ticonderoga](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ticonderoga)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, scramble [two rocket fighters](https://streamable.com/3dznp4).
    * The 12 ROCKETS deal 198 bdmg with 160/110/80 mods, and have a 60% chance to inflict a special Ignition on enemies struck. They are modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation stat.
  * Take -60% dmg for the first 4 hits sustained during a battle. Upon battle start and every 20s afterwards, grant the lead vanguard a hitshield (blocks up to 6 hits, lasts 8s).
  * Gain +10% Aviation. If deployed with 2+ CV/L, the flagship takes -15% dmg.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: The defender nobody asked for.
>Another Essex-class, another flop of a kit. Though certainly nowhere near as poorly designed as Intrepid's - the guaranteed (and admittedly powerful) rocket plane barrage is a definite improvement, as is the not-swapping set of buffs - this one focuses decidedly on defences. Big mistake.  
Her second skill is basically an empty slot. Under most circumstances the already low damage she'd sustain from incoming planes would waste the hefty reduction, and as a carrier she is at no real risk of getting shot at by BBs, taking the first half of the skill moot; as for the second half, it's a hitshield with a long cooldown and low durability. It'll be of little to no help.  
Her third skill is somewhat better, even if it enforces the use of carriers (though notably, not necessarily USS ones). If you fear for the safety of your flagship, she may be a good idea... but so is taking stronger units in your comp.
 
![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/YorktownChibi.png "USS Yorktown") - **[USS Yorktown](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yorktown)**
* Skill: 
  * Once per battle, if Yorktown's HP falls below 20% she heals herself by 25%
  * Upon receiving damage and on a 20s cooldown, launches three special SBD dive bombers (x1 2000lb, x2 100lb); 
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants +15% damage output to the vanguard for 8s.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

- Desc: "Putting the 'fleet' in 'fleet carrier'".
> One of the hardiest carriers in the game, Yorktown can cover any role fairly well courtesy of her balanced plane loadout, her frontline buff, her self-heal and her retaliatory SBD dive bombers; the price she pays for such sturdiness is DPS, however.
Do NOT think she can solo backline past W6. Carriers aren't made for that and she's no exception.

![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/Ark_RoyalChibi.png "Paedophile") - **[HMS Ark Royal](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ark_Royal)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, reduce all on-screen enemies' speed by 60% and launch 3 biplanes armed with 1 aimed torpedo each.
  * 25% chance to do double damage on Airstrike.
  * Has a 0/2/6 loadout.

* Desc: 
>A rare Torpedo-focused CV, coming stock with two powerful TB slots, a chance for double damage and a skill that lets her launch a few (largely ornamental) more while slowing any enemy on the screen.   
Whether it's boss-busting or wave-clearing, give her the appropriate planes and she'll do a pretty good job - just don't expect much of anything from her terrible DBs and definitely do not expect your carrier-based torp to magically all hit after the slow, though it will help.

 ![CVL](/Images-for-the-Guide/CentaurChibi.png "Centaur") - **[HMS Centaur](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Centaur)**
* Skill: 
  * Deal +10% damage vs BB; also, upon airstrike launch, deploy a volley of highly damaging, slowing (-40% speed for 6s), criss-crossing torpedoes from Swordfish planes.
  * Upon airstrike launch, grant +15% Aviation and +10% Firepower to the backline for 8s.
  * Has a 4/0/4 loadout.

* Desc: Centaur is the best generalist the game has to offer among its backliners.
>Aircraft got you down? Here's 4 Figthers, backed up by high Aviation and good efficiencies.  
Need to squeeze out some more damage? Her Swordfishes and 'conventional' torp bombers are pretty brutal.  
Backline could use some buffs or packing BBV? Whether it's carriers or battleships OR BOTH, she's got them (and herself) covered.  
Enemy ships are zipping around too much for your liking? Her Swordfishes inflict Slow and throw out two walls of crisscrossing torps, so they can have fun with that.  
Subs? Don't let her stats fool you, she's still a CVL and that means she can bomb them with impunity (and great effect at that).  
Whatever's getting you down, Centaur has the solution for it - and while she won't match the heights of more specalized units in their fields, her responses tend to be more than enough for most tasks at hand.  

 #### ![CVL](/Images-for-the-Guide/ChaserChibi.png "Chaser") - [HMS Chaser](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Chaser)
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, 15% chance to immediately reload it.
  * Upon airstrike launch, reveal all submarines on the screen for 10s and launch three biplanes armed with depth charges and two parallel torpedoes each.
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Chaser had a look at Ranger before leaving for the Royals and realised she was up to something good.  
With functionally 9 planes at her back and call without giving up her AA guns or high Reload, she can handily rival most other CVL in DPS while keeping some support capabilites to her credit - as well as a decent chance to throw out torrents of planes.  
That said, she's still mostly an attack craft - her ASW capabilties, while a nice touch, are entirely useless on non-ASW maps and unnecessary there, given how easily dealt with subs are.

 ![CVL](/Images-for-the-Guide/FormidableChibi.png "Obese Whore") - **[HMS Formidable](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Formidable)**
* Skill: 
  * Gain +15% Aviation and grant +15% efficiency to equipped Fairey Albacores; also, if equipped with at least one Fairey Albacore, launch a plane barrage (gif pending).
    * The 12 PARALLEL TORPEDOES deal 240 bdmg with 80/110/130 modifiers and a 80% chance to Flood for 8s. They are dropped by 2 ALBACORES in 2 separate diagonal waves of 6 parallel torpedoes each, and are modified by 120% of the unit's Aviation stat.
  * Upon airstrike launch, 80% (or 100% if first airstrike of the battle) chance to stop all enemies in place for 1.5s; stopped enemies regain their regular speed over the following 2.5s.
  * Take -8% damage; upon airstrike launch, the other backliners take -8% damage for 10s.
  * Has a 2/0/6 or 0/2/6 loadout.

* Desc: <insert overused jojo reference here>
>Unable to accept the fact she's overweight, Formidable insists that everyone be as *lumbering* as her. Rude.  
Pettiness aside, Formidable is definitely true to her name - not so much because of her damage output, which remarkable as it is still doesn't beat some of the bigger names out there, but because of the invaluable support her stop offers.  
Locking an enemy in place for a whole second and a half is more than enough for most big guns to get one full salvo on target, and the subsequent 2.5s' slowdown are enough to land a second - or allow other carriers to land the majority of their aimed torpedoes, for that matter. This all hinges on when she launches, however: if she is sortieing with carriers, have her launch last; if she's sortieing with battleships, have her launch first.
Formidable also happens to have a barrage if her Albacore tax is paid, but expect little from it unless she's in a mob fleet - the torpedoes are too spread apart from each other to ensure more than a couple of hits per spread, and that's not worth giving up the brutal damage output of a full aimed spread instead.
*About the Albacore...* it's terrible. Parallel torpedoes are bad enough as it is and this one doesn't even launch three, unlike the Barracuda; if you're taking one, it's strictly for the barrage.

 #### ![CVL](/Images-for-the-Guide/HermesKaiChibi.png "Hermes Kai") - [HMS Hermes Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hermes#retrofit)
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstriking, 25% chance to deal x2 damage for 10s.
  * Every 20s, launch one of three [barrages](http://p9.qhimg.com/t01a72c2315e7c4be51.gif); 33% chance for 1 HE nuke, 33% chance for 3 AP bombs; 34% chance for 24 Normal bomblets. Also, when her HP falls below 30%, gain 7 Luck.  
    * The 1 NUKE deals 294 bdmg AND a 50% chance to inflict Flooding; the 3 BOMBS deal 248 bdmg; the 24 BOMBLETS deal 72 bdmg. Their damage is modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation and all have the same 100/100/100 mods.
  * Has a 0/0/6 loadout.

* Desc: War games on motorcycles!
>Hellbent on dealing surface damage and dealing it (relatively) quickly, Hermes Kai boasts staggering amounts of Reload that allow her to airstrike in just about 19s with high-efficiency BiS torpedo bombers - and little to no support capabilities, which mostly come in screenclear form.  
Her skills further semi-reliably let her stack her hand, either by dealing more damage on both her airstrike and the subsequent barrage or just by barraging and potentially cracking single hard targets or dispatching a cluster of adds.  
All things considered - pretty okay, and very cheap to boot.

![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/IllustriousChibi.png "Lusty") - **[HMS Illustrious](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Illustrious)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants every vanguard unit a shield for 10% of Illustrious' max HP, lasting 8s.
  * Has a 6/0/2 loadout.

* Desc: Zero to (AS) Hero.
>A very defensive-focused CV with double fighter slots, a shield generator and staggering amounts of Air Superiority. To this day, her low DPS is the stuff of legend.    
Her niche is providing air superiority and protecting the frontline from harm through her shields - helpful, and while they won't replace proper healer support, they WILL help with skills proccing on damage sustained (eg. Eldridge) and keeping vanguards light on HP (eg. DDs) running for longer, especially on torpedo strikes. 
 
 ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/Illustrious_µChibi.png "Musty") - **[Muse Illustrious](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Illustrious_µ)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike reload, slow all enemy targets on screen by 30% for 4s and randomly proc one of three effects... -15% Eva for 10s / +15% damage dealt for vanguard and -10% damage taken for backline / -10% damage taken for vanguard, +10% damage dealt for backline.
  * Upon airstrike launch, launch two... [flying star sprinklers](https://streamable.com/zkmxlf).
    * The 18 STARS, dropped in 9x2 groups, deal 149 bdmg with 180/110/40 amods. 
  * Has a 6/0/2 loadout.

* Desc: Third time's the charm...
>At last, an Illustrious that's not a complete dead weight in terms of battlefield presence. Round of applause! Only took three years.  
Anyway, this epochal turn of events is mostly only due to a legitimately good Light Armour melting strafing run; her Efficiencies have shifted slightly towards the two torpedo bombers but they're still as anaemic as ever, while the fighters get worse and lose out on some of their AA prowess. The trade is... acceptable.  
As is the random set of buffs. None of them are bad, per se, but some are clearly preferable to others (ie. +10% backline dmg boost) and the slow is just kind of there, not really helping or hindering the fleet.  
All in all, the best Lusty you could hope for. Maybe the fourth one will be legitimately great.  
 
![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/EagleChibi.png "I can't believe it's not Bearn!") - [HMS Eagle](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Eagle)
* Role:
  * **Self-defence and long-range supportive fire capable mob fleet carrier**; fast airstrike carrier; average CV DPS.

* Skill: 
  * If mounting a CL gun in the third slot, gain +45% Efficiency for that slot (55% -> 100%), extend the gun's range to 80 and launch a [barrage](https://streamable.com/5mf5w7) every 24s. If mounting a Dive Bomber in the third slot, halve the cooldown on Eagle's first airstrike.
    * The 14 AP SHOTS deal 28 bdmg with 40/125/120 armour modifiers; the 44 HE SHOTS deal 20 bdmg with 120/60/60 armour modifiers. Both are modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * Upon airstrike, launch three Swordfishes dropping two parallel torpedoes each.
    * The 6 TORPEDOES deal 288 bdmg 80/110/130 armour modifiers; they are modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation stat.
  * Has a 3/2*/3 loadout; her 3rd slot may be filled with a Dive Bomber (launches two planes) or a CL gun (fires twice).

* Desc: 
>Béarn but HMS and overall worse.  
Dropping the VF17-like bombs and the torp line for six parallels was a poor deal, as was losing the rather absurd torp stats she could use to pad Hardmode requirements; the +41FP she gets in return are just not enough to make the trade worthwhile, and the one benefit she may have over Béarn is her being HMS and thus synergising with many want-HMS skills.  
P.S.: I know it's Béarn's barrage in the gif, but it's also the exact same barrage. They didn't put in the effort to give her something unique, so why should I? c:

  * **Fleetwide healer, inter-fleet healer;** low DPS (low Airstrike damage, average Barrage damage); preloaded.

* Skill: 
  * Commence the battle with two preloaded airstrikes, but have airstrike cooldowns slowed by -90%; on airstrike launch, heal vanguards by 7% of their max HP and backliners by 3.5% of their max HP.

    * The 4 HORNET BOMBS deal 335 bdmg with 80/95/115 armour modifiers; the 4 FIREFLY BOMBS deal 402 bdmg with 80/95/115 armour modifiers; the 6 AVENGER PARALLELS deal 342 bdmg with 80/110/130 armour modifiers. All are modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation stat.
  * Increase max amount of stored airstrikes by +1; every 20s, heal all units in the fleet by 1% of their max HP; when the fleet in which Perseus is not in fights, heal their units by 3% of their max HP after 20s since the start of the battle.
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>By both healer and carrier standards, Perseus stands out as very unconventional - no other carrier frontloads her entire kit, after all.  
Perseus, unlike all other carriers in the game, starts with two whole airstrikes already primed: as her main heals are tied to the airstrikes, this means she'll be able to patch up an ailing fleet almost immediatelty and thus prevent (at least for a bit) timely demises while her early strikes damage the first waves of mobs. Past that, however, her fleet will be stuck with a very low intensity passive fleetwide regen; better than nothing, but won't save anyone on its own.  
To some extent, this applies to her damage as well; once the airstrikes are out, she's forced to rely almost entirely on her random 12s planes for DPS, which may be nice but aren't a proper airstrike, nor do they have a strong Aviation stat to bolster them. Again, better than nothing, but won't destroy much on its own.  
Lastly, she can lob a heal over to the fleet in which she isn't; helpful for patching up pre-boss battle damage.

As is customary for IJN sister ships, they truly shine when used together - but even when taken on their own, it cannot be understated how valuable that early launch (and extra screenclear) is.

Exceptional.

  * Decrease the damage the vanguard takes from enemy submarines by -12%; upon submarine fleet arrival in battle, heals them by 20% of their max HP; finally, whenever your submarines sink an enemy unit, gain a +3.5% damage stack up to a max of 6 stacks (+21% dmg total).

* Desc: 
>Lo and behold, at long last a new healer! A **real** one, this time around, and capable of fixing up backliners as well!  
The way she heals is highly unconventional, not just because it is based on her own HP pool rather than the healed's but also because it only affects one unit at a time: as a result she won't heal as much as Shouhou or Unicorn do (unless you're running an undersized vanguard or a DD-heavy one) but she won't be overhealing either, and of course she'll be able to target the back too.  
The boost her healing gets when sortied in a full backline is substantial, but so will be your oil costs; evaluate carefully whether you do need that help or you can manage without it.  
Her armament strikes a nice middle ground between offence and support, sporting 130% Fighters and 145% Torpedo Bombers; not as powerful as Shouhou, but she won't be up a creek without a paddle when planes come a-knockin'.  
As for the submarines... she has those skills? It's a good set of skills, to be sure, but it's unlikely to see much usage. Still, better with than without.

#### ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/ShinanoChibi.png "Kaga Mk2") - [IJN Shinano](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shinano)
* Role:
  * **Barrager Supercarrier** (higher-than-normal plane count), **extreme Aviation DPS, enemy damage/DPS debuff**, IJN carrier support, DD support.

* Skill: 
  * 3s after the start of the battle, launch a Saiun (debuffer plane). Upon airstrike launch, also launch 2 Shiden Kai fighters, 2 Ryusei torpbombers, and 1 Saiun.
    * The 4 SHIDEN KAI BOMBS deal 300 bdmg with 80/90/110 mods; the 6 RYUSEI TORPEDOES deal 240 bdmg with 80/110/130 mods; the SAIUN is unarmed but affects an enemy with 1 stack of +3% damage taken and -3% damage dealt. The BOMB damage is modified by 80% of the Aviation stat, the TORP damage by 100% of it, the SAIUN DEBUFF can stack up to three times.
  * Every 15s, launch a [wide frontal barrage](https://streamable.com/zgtsmt); gain +15% Aviation for the first two battles of the sortie, and fire the same barrage once for the OTHER fleet from the third battle onwards.
    * The 50 BUTTERFLIES deal 20 bdmg 100/80/60 mods; they are modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation stat IF SHINANO IS LAUNCHING IT, if it is being fired in support, it is modified by 100% of the SUPPORT FLAGSHIP's Aviation stat... even if it's not a carrier.
  * Grant +15% FP/Evasion/ASW to all DD in the vanguard; also, upon battle start and if the fleet has 3+ IJN units, grant +15% Aviation/Accuracy to all IJN carriers and take -20% shelling/aviation damage.
  * Has a 2*/3/4 loadout; her 1st slot may be filled with any type of plane. Costs 15 Oil, though.

* Desc: They wanted a Yamato. They didn't specify which one.
>True to her class, Shinano does her line honour both in terms of size and historical irrelevance; neither accomplished much of anything beyond sinking, and both were truly titanic vessels.  
Unlike her historical counterpart, however, Shinano is **stacked** with planes; not only is she the only carrier in the game with **9** 'proper' ones, with every airstrike she also scrambles five extra planes (four of which armed), for a grand total of about ***14*** (more like 13, when accounting for overall damage) aircraft.  
It goes without saying that this grants her a damage output well beyond that of the vast majority of high-end carriers, and is compounded both by a decent barrage (mostly for mobbing as flagship, given the wide pattern) and a self-damage buff for the first two battles of the sortie (mostly for bossing purposes, but not necessarily).  
Her support suite isn't lacking either, given the slew of buffs she grants to DDs and IJN carriers; perhaps more interesting though is the stacking de-buff granted by her Saiun, which will help taking the edge off of tougher opponents.  
Overall, Shinano is a worth addition to most fleets thanks to her stellar damage output (by carrier standards, yes, but it can keep up with high-end battleships) and her valuable support. Consider carefully in which capacity you want to use her, as while she can cover a variety of roles, she works better if specialised.   

![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/ShoukakuChibi.png "IJN Shoukaku") - **[IJN Shoukaku](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shoukaku)**
* Skill: 
  * On launching an airstrike, gives a fleetwide increase of damage dealt by 10% and reduces damage taken fleetwide by 10% for 12s.
  * When paired with Zuikaku, gain +30% Aviation and TAKE +10% damage.
  * Has a 2/2/4 loadout.

* Desc: 
>More support-based than her sister and frailer than she when her other half is around, but more than makes up for it thanks to the +30% Aviation she gets as well as the buffs she throws out (which incidentally also partially negate the debuff).  
Her buffs and layout are good enough to warrant usage even solo; so good, in fact, that you don't want to use her with Zuikaku.  
As a duo the Cranes just don't work at all if you consider the following: the damage ramp takes two whole minutes to allow them to outdamage either IJN duo, meaning the fight will be already over by then (or you'll have lost the S rank) and the AA coverage is poor (only 4 fighters across 2 carriers).  

 ![CVL](/Images-for-the-Guide/ShouhouKaiChibi.png "IJN Shouhou Kai") - **[IJN Shouhou Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shouhou)**
* Skill: 
  * On launching an airstrike, heals the escort fleet by 8% of their HP.
  * On launching an airstrike, +15% Aviation to all CV/L for 8s.
  * Has a 0/3/3 loadout.


* Desc: 
>Trades Unicorn's passive frontline Reload buff for a temporary Aviation buff and a significantly superior statline, HP pool aside.  
Can't match Unicorn in air superiority, lacking fighters, but decisively asserts her dominance in raw damage output - which is what tends to matter the most, most of the time.

![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/TaihouChibi.png "Taihou") - **[IJN Taihou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Taihou)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon completion of an airstrike cooldown, she has a 100% chance to launch a random airstrike out of three (a Suisei carpet bombing, a flight of 6 Ryusei, a Saiun backline damage booster) and a 25% chance to launch the others.
  * Take -20% HE and Aviation damage.
  * Has a 2/3/3 loadout.

* Desc: Lady Luck is a bitch.
>Taihou is as fickle as she is horrifyingly powerful, equally suited to razing waves and demolishing single targets.
As the proud owner of not one, not two, but three whole separate plane 'barrges' and a bombardment-oriented plane loadout, she is guaranteed to set the oceans ablaze multiple times over, if given the chance(s) to do so - and even if said chances weren't forthcoming, her Heavy Armour, massive HP pool and defensive skill allow her to weather the storms until the next die can be cast.  
On a sidenote, she's also one of the carriers least affected by enemy AA boats due to the sheer volume of aircraft she can unleash. Nice.

#### ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/ZuikakuChibi.png "Zuikaku")- **[IJN Zuikaku](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Zuikaku)** 
* Skill: 
  * If deployed with 3+ IJN units, deal +20% damage. Upon airstrike launch, gain a +20% damage dealt stack (up to +60%).
  * When paired with Shoukaku, gain +20% Aviation and take -20% damage.
  * Has a 2/3/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>A tough carrier designed for prolonged fights, which basically means 'boss battles only'.  
Her skill barely contributes to most battles, and without her sister ship she's missing out a fair chunk of the stats that let her ramp up be as effective as it can be; while the buff to her first skill graciously gifted her a +20% damage boost, her efficiencies remain rather lacklustre and the ramp is as slow as ever.  
If this still sounds like a "don't use her"... well, yeah. Don't, she'll only drag everyone down.

![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/Graf_ZeppelinChibi.png "KMS Graf Zeppelin") - **[KMS Graf Zeppelin](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Graf_Zeppelin)** 
* Roles:
  * **Main KMS damage CV**, KMS fleet defender.
* Skill: 
  * KMS units take -15% less damage; also, gain +5% Aviation (up to +15%) for every KMS unit in the fleet.
  * If mounting at least one KMS aircraft, gain +30% efficiency on all aircraft slots.
  * Has a 2/3/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Now rid of the poor 2/6/0 loadout, granted a hefty Aviation boost for doing her job (ie. bolstering KMS unit defences) and a much preferable activation condition for her Efficiency boost, Graf Zeppelin has become a much more competitive choice... even if still mainly in the employ of KMS fleets, rather than universal ones. 
Still, she's better than she's ever been and with efficiencies as remarkable as hers, entirely capable of making good on all that chuuni talk about laying the world to waste.  

#### ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/Peter_StrasserChibi.png "Easy Pete") - [KMS Peter Strasser](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Peter_Strasser)
* Role:
  * **KMS damage CV**, minor passive slow and RNG stop.

* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike, launch two extra Torpedo Bombers.
    * The 6 AIMED AIRTORPS deal 240 bdmg with 80/110/130 armour modifiers; they are modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation.
  * Lower enemy speed passively by 8%; every 1s, there's a 10% chance to stop all enemies on screen for 3s (has a 7s cooldown).
  * Gain +5% Aviation for every KMS unit in the fleet (up to +15%); if sortied with 4+ KMS units, all KMS carriers' first 3 airstrikes load 10% faster.
  * Has a 2/3/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>In a customary display of inability to understand why a unit is good, the devs thought simply giving a carrier a stop was enough to make it good; and that in order to balance a more frequent slow, making it RNG would be a good idea.  
They were ***very*** wrong... but Peter Strasser manages to be very solid even in spite of their incompetence, mainly because of the high DPS (which she owes to the good loadout supplemented by the extra aimed TBs); unfortunately, her intended job cannot be as easily redeemed because a stop is used *tactically* (ie. when your other carriers have launched or your BB are about to fire) and not *casually*, which is what Pete unfortunately does. At best, this makes the stop unreliable *if* capable of stopping enemies for a remarkably long time, at worst it risks making your other backliners miss their already launched ordnance.  
Criminally botched design. Still very competent.

#### ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/BéarnChibi.png "The e is also accented") - [FFNF Bearn](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Béarn)
* Role:
  * **Self-defence and long-range supportive fire capable mob fleet carrier**; fast airstrike carrier; average CV DPS; universal Hardmode stat padder.

* Skill: 
  * If mounting a CL gun in the third slot, gain +45% Efficiency for that slot (55% -> 100%), extend the gun's range to 80 and launch a [barrage](https://streamable.com/5mf5w7) every 24s. If mounting a Dive Bomber in the third slot, halve the cooldown on Béarn's first airstrike.
    * The 14 AP SHOTS deal 28 bdmg with 40/125/120 armour modifiers; the 44 HE SHOTS deal 20 bdmg with 120/60/60 armour modifiers. Both are modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * 5s after Béarn's airstrike has come off cooldown, launch a [plane and torpedo barrage](https://streamable.com/zmbrst). This barrage can only be launched up to three times per battle.
    * The 6 BOMBS deal 380 bdmg with 80/90/110 armour modifiers; the 4 TORPEDOES deal 96 bdmg with 70/90/120 armour modifiers. The bombs are modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation, while the torpedoes are modified by 80% of the unit's Torpedo stat.
  * Has a 3/2*/3 loadout; her 3rd slot may be filled with a Dive Bomber (launches two planes) or a CL gun (fires twice).

* Desc: 
>What's better than a carrier that's decked head to toe in guns? One that's decked head to toe in guns *and* has torpedoes, of course!  
One of the most *peculiar* examples of carrier the war has birthed, Béarn is a very unconventional creature focusing on providing semi-costant fire support, be it through her barrage and CL guns or the accelerated airstrike and the post-cooldown extra airstrikes.   
Her damage output is very average by CV standards, however, and shouldn't be relied upon against bosses; her kit is better suited to acting as a mob fleet flagship of sorts anyway.

#### ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/AquilaChibi.png "Aquila") - **[RN Aquila](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Aquila)**
* Roles:
  * **Single Back/Front targeted healer AND shielder** or **High DPS w/ preload**, AA supporter.

* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, 75% chance to scramble [two fighters and two aimed torpedo bombers](https://streamable.com/5mb3u6)
    * The 4 BOMBS deal 162 bdmg with 80/85/100 armour modifiers; the 4 AIMED TORPEDOES deal 240 bdmg with 80/100/130 armour modifiers. The bombs are modified by 80% of the unit's Aviation, the Torpedoes by 100% of it.
  * If her second slot uses a FIGHTER, upon airstrike... heal the most damaged vanguard and backline units for 8% of their max HP, and grant both an HP shield blocking up to 6% of their max HP's worth of damage. If her second slot uses a DIVE BOMBER... start battles with a preloaded airstrike, decrease her airstrike cooldowns by -10%, and deal +8% damage.
  * Take -12% damage; also, for every 3 aircraft shot down by Aquila, grant +5% AA fleetwide (up to +15%). 
  * Has a 4/0/4 OR a 2/2/4 loadout. The second slot may accommodate Dive Bombers upon reaching Max Limit Break.

* Desc: 
>One of the, if not THE, most flexible carrier in the game, Aquila can either be ~~ur angle or ur debil~~ an exceptional healer and protector or an accomplished and fast damage dealer depending on which loadout you choose to give her. It's almost like having two carriers in one!  
In her healer configuration, she gets extra mileage out of her kit by running 1:1s or 2:1s with tough CA/CL; in her DPS configuration, which you should consider using if your units aren't going to keel over anyways, she'll perform somewhat better on mobbing duties most of the time because of the aforementioned preload (and her damage output, which isn't quite as high as that of fully dedicated DPS CV).  

#### ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/Tokino_SoraChibi.png "Generic Moeblob")- **[Tokino Sora](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Tokino_Sora)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike, 100% chance to launch a barrage.
    * The 15 STARS deal 122 bdmg with 110/110/110 armour mods; Ignition chance is 1.5% and they prefer to 'fall' on chibi first. Their damage is modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation stat and a 118% coefficient.
  * Decrease damage taken by all Hololive units by 7%; also, every 20s, reduce enemy Speed by -10%, increase allied Hit by 10% and increase Hololive units' Speed by 10% for 8s.
  * Has a 2/3/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Pretty solid if somewhat unremarkable carrier. Out of the Hololive bunch she's the one that has most to offer to her fellows, but she's likely to put in a good performance even among regular units, courtesy of her generally okay kit; the +10% Hit sounds good, and it is, but don't make the mistake of thinking it's enough to offset her mediocre statline.  
The barrage warrants a mention, in that it is a rain of little star-shaped pellets somewhat slowly falling from the sky and attempting to aim for enemy chibi; their damage is pretty high, but the AoEs are small and the long travel time somewhat hampers their effectiveness.
Serviceable enough.

    * The 3 BOMBS deal 300 bdmg with 80/90/110 armour mods. The damage is modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation stat.
  * Upon battle start, randomly pick one of four buffs (gain +12% AA, gain +12% Aviation, gain +12% Reload, gain -20% airstrike cooldown for the first airstrike).
  * Has a 3/2/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>An adequate carrier with no readily distinguishable quality, she doesn't DPS particularly hard (or much, for that matter) nor does she support particularly well; she's competent enough at her job and flings some extra planes about on airstike, but that's kind of it.

    * The 48 CARPET BOMBS deal 200 bdmg with 100/100/100 amods; they are dropped in lines of 4, slowly creeping forward. The damage is modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation stat.

### Honourable Mentions:

#### ![CVL](/Images-for-the-Guide/BogueKaiChibi.png "USS Bogue Kai") - **[USS Bogue Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Bogue)**
* Skill: 
  * 15% activation when launching an airstrike, the next airstrike becomes available immediately
  * Increases AA for backline by 15%, does not stack with other command skills that have similar effect.
  * Has a 3/3/0 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Similar in concept and usage to Ranger, her airstrikes come out faster but don't provide close to the same weight of fire.  
Still, high plane efficiency coupled with a neat AA buff for the backline allows her to be decently useful and cost-effective in most situations.

#### ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/WaspChibi.png "USS Wasp") - [USS Wasp](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Wasp)
* Skill: 
  * When deployed w/ at least 1 HMS backliner and upon airstrike launch, 50% chance to launch a Spitfire squadron.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

- Desc: "SMOL WASP YO"
>The cheapest CV in the game, by virtue of her Blue rarity... and that's pretty much it, as far as remarkable features go.  
Her staline is somewhat lacklustre, her skill doesn't add much to her DPS and pushes you into using HMS backliners.  
While definitely usable, her only real use case would be plugging Hard Mode enforced ship requirements.

#### ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/Akagi-chanChibi.png "Akagi-chan") - [IJN Akagi-chan](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akagi-chan)
* Skill: 
  * If in a fleet with 3+ IJN units, 12s after the start of the battle launches a special plane barrage (3 Type 99 w/ x1 500lb, x2 100lb bombs; 80% Aviation)
  * Upon airstriking, the vanguard ship with the lowest HP becomes invincible for 5s.
  * Has a 3/2/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Smol Akagi is an interesting little thing, with those invincibility-granting airstrikes of hers - but lacking a real purpose in an environment crowded with excellent IJN DPS carriers, not least of which Akagi proper (against which her barrage really can't stack up), and a better vanguard protection in the form of Illustrious' bubble.
However, invincibility *can* go where no bubble has gone before in EX maps...

#### ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/Akagi_(Muse)Chibi.png "Musikagi") - [Muse Akagi](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akagi_(Muse))
* Skill: 
  * 10s after launching her first airstrike and depending on the amount (odd/even) of Muse units in the fleet, launch a dive bomber/torpedo bomber barrage.
    * The 6 500lb BOMBS deal 226bdmg w/ 80/90/110 mods; the 12 100lb BOMBS deal 96 bdmg w/ 80/85/100 mods. Both are modified by 80% of the unit's Aviation stat.
    * The 12 AIRTORPS deal 240 bdmg w/ 80/110/130 mods. They are modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation stat.
  * Her first airstrike's cooldown is reduced by 40%; also, gain +10% Aviation for every other Muse unit in the fleet, up to +40%.
  * Has a 3/2/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>So Akagi now has the dubious honour of having not one but *two* whole very questionable alternate versions. Yay?  
At any rate, Muse Akagi is absolutely worthless outside of a Muse fleet - her skills just do not work without them and no less than a full fleet will make her comparable to the regular one - and desperately needs that +40% Aviation to be relevant, as the barrages themselves are one-offs and suffer from low damage on top of that.

#### ![CVL](/Images-for-the-Guide/HoushouChibi.png "IJN Houshou") - [IJN Houshou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Houshou)
* Skill: 
  * Increases experience gained by CV/L by 15%
  * +15% Aviation to all CV/L for 8s after Houshou launches an airstrike.
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>The first carrier to ever sail the seas, and it shows. As THE early prototype for the ships that would later dominate the oceans, she's incredibly weak and brought further down by her mandatory CL gun - which can barely deal scratch damage, owing to her 0 Firepower statline.  
Why is she even mentioned, then? Because her +XP skill stacks with Langley's, that's why, and having her around as a 0LB exp booster may be a good idea to hasten the leveling process.

#### ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/WeserChibi.png "Weser") - [KMS Weser](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Weser)
* Role:
  * ... Hitshield generator?

* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike, 70% chance to launch two extra Dive Bombers; if sortied with 3+ KMS units, gain +20% CritDmg, or if Weser is the only KMS unit in the fleet, launch one extra Dive Bomber, gain +30% proc chance, 10% Reload and +15% Aviation.
    * The 4/6 500lb BOMBS deal 207 bdmg with 80/110/130 armour modifiers; they are modified by 80% of the unit's Aviation.
  * Every 20s, generate two revolving hitshields (6 hits max) around a random vanguard unit, lasting up to 8s; if the unit was KMS, it gains +15% FP for 8s and Weser heals for 5% of her own max HP.
  * Has a 3/3/0 loadout.

* Desc: 
>An interesting enough concept, unfortnately marred by typically subpar CVL statlines and a lack of torpedo bombers... and, more crucially, the sheer lack of relevant support capabilities to make up for it.  
Hitshields are notoriously prone to getting shot apart in seconds, with only anti-torpedo ones or fixed front-facing ones managing to accomplish much of worth; hers are of neither sort and are flimsy on top of that. The +15% FP boost is halfway decent, but many much better carriers offer vanguard-wide +15% damage boosts instead, so... 
Unlikely to see any use outside of KMS fleets, and even those will find themselves hardly pressed to justify her presence.

#### ![CV](/Images-for-the-Guide/ZeppyChibi.png "Zeppy") - [KMS Zeppy](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Zeppy)
* Skill: 
  * Every 8s, gain a stack of +80FP; when 3 stacks are reached, fires a special barrage (large V of AP shots with minor diagonal lines of AP shots) with increased damage if mounting a CL gun.
  * Gain +5% AA, Aviation and Reload for every KMS unit in the fleet.
  * Has a 3/3*/0 loadout; her 3rd slot may be filled with a Dive Bomber (launches two planes) or a CL gun (fires twice).

* Desc: 
>One of the very few carriers fully capable of defending themselves, and actually contributing somewhat to the fight through her barrage.  
A remarkable claim to fame for her class, but somewhat let down by her poor efficiencies and poor offensive statline; fielding her in a KMS fleet is all but necessary to have her compete in battle effectiveness with light carriers.  
She *does* keep Tirpitz happy, though.

## SS ![SS](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518517758602903554/563432311782113350/SS_img.png "Submarine Icon")
### A few preliminary notes

"Submarines" are powerful but specialized tools that behave rather differently from your ordinary fleets.
Here's a quick rundown of how they work.

1. You cannot control them directly; they will spawn in one of several fixed locations on every map and will stay there until you give them the command to relocate elsewhere (which costs a tiny amount of oil, roughly 1 + sub amount + tiles to move).  
2. Submarine fleets move 2 tiles per turn, ignoring geography, and shave off up to 20% max HP (more with submarine-boosting meowfficers) off of ALL enemies in the node, and may also be summoned in battle if your regular fleets are fighting within said range. Map strike damage depends on the sub fleet's overall Power Rating, in-battle damage depends on the usual mechanics.  
3. Submarine fleets in battle act as a sort of tactical nuke button; when summoned they will join the fight in person and unleash inordinate amounts of torpedoes via barrages to brutalize everything unfortunate enough to be on screen at the time, then stay for roughly 20s (exact amount depends on their Oxygen stat, with 10 Oxy equaling 1s) firing their 'regular' torpedoes until they run out of O2 and have to surface.  
4. Unless in possession of skills saying otherwise, every sub carries 2 Ammo with her; this ammo is expended for Map Strikes and Call-Ins, and unlike normal fleets, once they're out of ammo they're completely out of the fight.  
5. Submarine statlines are generally very similar to one another, barring a few exceptions; as it is with BBs and BCs, skills are the main discriminant here.  
6. Gear is very important in order to have them perform. Do your damn SOS missions, fellas.  

Given these premises, it quickly becomes apparent that **submarine fleets are meant to be fielded as a trio**; whether it be mauling nodes on the map or providing heavy torpedo support, they only reach peak efficiency as a full fleet, and in the case of map strikes such efficiency comes at no oil cost whatsoever.  
As such, this section *does not contain tiers* but specific recommendations and groupings - let's get to them.

  * Gain +6% Torp/Reload per KMS submarine in the fleet.

* Desc: Achtung - U-Boot!
>Given real world Germany's history with submarines, it comes as no surprise that the Ironblood gets the apex specimens of their class.  
Highly synergistic, they all benefit from hanging out with each other but are frail and somewhat lacking in support options otherwise - murdering stuff in call-ins is what they do best and that's all they do, but they better not take casualties.  
*About U-37...* she's the designated Light Armour murderer, and since she tends to stick around for longer than normal thanks to the O2/Rld boosts, she's also exceptionally good at it. The extra O2 also lets her use slower torps without a snorkel.  
*About U-47...* yes, she does have a solo skill; no, you do not use her solo. You're taking her for her brutal damage output, not because of the solo meme skill.
*About U-81...* she torpedoes harder and gains more than the others from having fellow countrychildren around.  
*About U-96...* the cheerleader of the bunch, she'll throw around lovely buffs for the rest of them and otherwise play like everyone else in there.
*About U-101...* being able to close the distance with the enemy drastically lowers the chance to physically miss the target and frees up a slot for the Pressurised Hull aux item (unless the enemy is *that* far away, which is very unlikely).  
*About U-110...* COMMENCE RNG FIESTA! Or don't, the buffs are minimal and there's no guarantee you'll get the ones you want when you actually need them. Still better than 556 though.  
*About U-522...* the call-in from across the map is a bit of a meme since you can move your fleet around anyway, but the extra O2 is just enough to let her skip Snorkels in favour of another Oxytorp.  
*About U-556...* yes, having someone reach critical HP is a terrible condition for a barrage and there is no real upside to it.
*About all of them...* their barrages are semi-homing, just like regular acoustic torps. Have fun.

* Skill (I-19): 
  * 8s after joining the battle, launches a wave of penetrating torpedoes (up to 2 pierces, similarly to AP shells).
  * I-19's torpedoes lose 1 Speed and deal +12% Damage.
  
* Skill (I-56): 
  * If the Airspace Control status isn't Air Denial or Air Incapability, gain +15% FP/Torp/Reload.
  * I-56's torpedoes lose 1 Speed and deal +12% Damage.
  
* Skill (I-168): 
  * Deal +20% Damage to CV; also, launch a special torpedo barrage with 100% CritRate upon surfacing.
  * I-168's torpedoes lose 1 Speed and deal +12% Damage.
  
* Desc: Large and Discharge.
>Much larger and better supplied than their KMS counterparts, this line of IJN attack submarines trade synergy for heavy duty torpedoes, torpedo barrages and somewhat thicker hulls.  
About all of them... don't mind the slower torpedoes, it's actually a benefit rather than a detriment! Fast torpedoes may well zip past the intended target if it moved, but slow ones have a good chance to strike that target on the way back.

* Skill (Albacore): 
  * Deal +10% Damage to DD, CL and CV.
  * Launches a special torpedo barrage with 70% Ignition chance upon surfacing.

* Skill (Bluegill):
  * Deal +15% Damage to DD/CL.
  * Gain +40 Oxygen.

* Skill (Cavalla): 
  * Lower the damage taken by subs by -15%; also, upon leaving the fight, heals 8% of her max HP.
  * Deal +20% damage to CV; also, fires a torpedo barrage when surfacing whose damage increases by 15% if sortied with Albacore.

* Skill (Dace): 
  * Deal +15% Damage to CA.
  * Gain +40 Oxygen.

* Skill (I-26): 
  * Deal +15% Damage to CV.
  * Gain +40 Oxygen.
  
* Skill (I-58): 
  * Deal +15% Damage to CA; also, launches a special toepedo barrage upon surfacing.

* Desc: O2 Jamming.
>A rather diverse bunch of girls, these ones, but they all share a trait - their Oxygen tanks are ample enough to accommodate for two full Mark 16 torpedo volleys, which means they can safely be ran with dual Oxygen Torpedoes.  
*About I-58...* she is a solid starter, as she gets a special barrage to go along the extra O2.

 #### ![SS](/Images-for-the-Guide/ArcherfishChibi.png "Archbish") - [USS Archerfish](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Archerfish)
* Skill: 
  * Deal +15% dmg to Heavy Armour. Also, if sortied with 2+ USS subs, grant +15% CritDmg and +8% Torp/Acc to all USS subs.
  * Gain +20 O2 and launch a barrage when surfacing.

* Desc:
>The USN's own flagsub buffer, she boasts an ideal kit for sub duties and a stronger-than-normal statline on top of that. An obvious pick if you intend on using other USS subs.
 
#### ![SS](/Images-for-the-Guide/SurcoufChibi.png "Surcouf") - [FFNF Surcouf](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Surcouf)
* Skill: 
  * Upon joining the battle, grant +20% Accuracy to the vanguard.
  * Upon surfacing, fire her barrage and stay on the field for 12s longer.
  * Mounts a unique CA gun instead of the regular DD guns. It's good.

* Desc: On v ya!
>Surcouf is unique among subs for several reasons, not least of which her ability to stand her ground while surfaced.
Firstly, her guns are not only actually useful but also threatening; secondly, she bolsters the vanguard's fighting prowess with a hefty Accuracy buff; thirdly, she stays on the field for longer than anyone else while making full use of her entire armament throughout it all.
Her one downside is a subpar hunting range, but she's not meant to stay front and centre anyway.

#### ![SSV](/Images-for-the-Guide/I-13Chibi.png "Seaslug") - [IJN I-13](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/I-13)
* Skill: 
  * Upon joining the battle, launch a unarmed Saiun and grant +10% Damage to the backline.
  * Gain +40 Oxygen.
  * Mounts a pair of Seaplanes instead of the regular DD guns. Still better than DD guns, and actually good if said seaplanes are Seiran.

* Desc: Say What? to Blue Alien.
>Ah yes, submarine carriers - yet another of those wacky and not really effective IJN designs which to this day garner popularity, if only because of how unhinged they were.  
I-13 is the first of her class to reach Azur Lane, and despite the very mixed historical results, she puts on an impressive showing here - the damage buff is extremely welcome, the extra Oxygen nixes the need for a snorkel, her hunting range is comfortably wide and her Seiran can make a real contribution to the fight.  
On the flipside, her barrage is extremely linear and runs the very real risk of being entirely wasted if sortied as a sideliner.

#### ![SS](/Images-for-the-Guide/I-25Chibi.png "I-25") - [IJN I-25](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/I-25)
* Skill: 
  * Upon joining the battle, launch a Type 0 Seaplane armed with a single bomb and grant +10% Accuracy to all subs in the fleet.
  * Upon surfacing, launch a torpedo barrage; also, her gunfire and barrage torpedoes have a 70% chance to lower the Reload/Acc of the enemies struck by 10%.

* Desc:
>A heavy-duty support submarine, I-25 forgoes the damage boosts many others have in favour of buffs and debuffs.  
It is a questionable tradeoff: the bomb damage is negligible at best, the +Acc boost goes mostly wasted as subs already do very well for themselves on that front, and the debuff potency is somewhat questionable despite it being tied to gunfire (which should not be in range) and barrage torps.  


#### ![SS](/Images-for-the-Guide/Minato_AquaChibi.png "Submaid") - [Minato Aqua](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Minato_Aqua)
* Skill: 
  * Lose 60 o2; deal +30% damage upon call-in; gain +100% Speed upon surfacing and start retreating immediately.
  * Upon call-in, grant a randomly chosen fleetwide buff (+2% damage dealt, -2% damage taken, +4% Evasion, +4% Accuracy, 10HP healed); if the unit affected is Hololive, increase effect potency by 50%.
  * Upon call-in, launch a tight v-shaped autocritting torpedo barrage; if there are 2+ Hololive units in the fleet, repeat the barrage once.

* Desc:
>A mean and cowardly beatstick, Aqua goes in hard but *really* doesn't like to outstay her welcome - past her 20s powerful burst, her damage falls off significantly and the moment she peeks her head outside the water, unlike every other sub in circulation she'll beat a very hasty retreat instead of hanging around for a few extra seconds to fling one or two more torpedoes. 
Don't expect the buff to do much, either; it's better than nothing, but its impact should not be overstated given its low potency (even when applied to Hololive units).  
Despite the quirks, she's still a powerful sub and one you need not fear will cripple your subfleet's effectiveness when taken.

### A few notes, and Vestal

"Repair Ship" is a misnomer for these crafts, to say the least. Here are the reasons why ---> https://pastebin.com/RucY4TwC  
TLDR; they contribute little to nothing to the fight, their healing is pathetic and vastly outclassed as soon as you use more than a single DD for your vanguard, the +1 ammo is easily negated by a single ambush (and given the inability to attack surface targets they can't assist the fleet in the battle either) and they cost the same as the much superior healer options (Unicorn / Shouhou / Arizona).  
However, **Vestal** - unlike Akashi - has a few redeeming features that make her worth taking along for lategame low(ish)-cost farming, provided you don't mind the increase in clearing times.

#### ![AR](/Images-for-the-Guide/VestalChibi.png "USS Vestal") - [USS Vestal](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Vestal)
* Skill: 
  * Once per battle, Vestal heals a ship under 20% HP by 20% of the healed's HP; if the target is Enterprise, the healing amount is increased by 50%.
  * Begin each Sortie with 3 Emergency Repairs (consumable +10% fleetwide HP heals, used in the map screen). 
 
* Desc: "Vestal is Bestal".  
>"Wait, Vestal? Why not Akashi? Isn't her heal better?", you may be asking yourself - and you'd be right, Akashi's healing capacity is technically better. And it doesn't matter in the slightest.  
As covered above, Repair Ships are *terrible* healers and far outshone by cheaper/stronger/both options; competing with them is a lost cause.  
What you seek in a Repair Ship is utility, and Vestal brings a surprising amount of it to the table: be it through her rescue skill, guaranteed to save an ailing backliner's sorry arse, her stellar AA suite (two AA gun slots, each benefiting from the ARs' inbuilt +1 AGM, and three auxiliary slots you can fill with AA radars to kick her plane offence into high gear), and the usual 3 fleetwide consumable heals.  
She won't clear quick and she's obviously more suited to high-AA environments, but she *will* get the job done.
