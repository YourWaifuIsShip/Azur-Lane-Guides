# Your Waifu is SHIP's opinionated & extra-biased Unit Guide (TEA TOTALLER EDITION)

## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
Be it because of the very generous gacha, distinctly not predatory monetisation, the shoot-em-up RPG gameplay or the ever-increasing unit roster, Azur Lane stands out among oceans of mobage for several reasons; the most relevant of which, in my opinion, is fostering a Pokémon-esque approach to compbuilding, where the player is encouraged and/or expected to use the units they like the most, rather than simply homing into the 'strongest' ones.  
  
While a very laudable approach, it is also one that lends itself to misconceptions of the toxic casual "ez gaem lmao use w/e ur gud" variety: to quote a wise Azur Lane Community member, "just because it works, it doesn't mean it's good": while all units are indeed viable, there are clearly objectively superior ones, and this Tierless Guide aims to identify who are they and for what reasons.  
A few years at this and counting, and it's become to me abundantly clear that tiers cause a lot more issues than they actually solve; most people only pay attention to the tier and ignore the reasons why they're tiered that way, engage in pointless debates over which tier is *right* (like it's not all subjective anyway) and are left knowing just as much as they did before about the unit itself or how they are supposed to use it.  
  
The Tierless Guide means to dispense with all that nonsense and tell you all the important stuff, with none of the nastiness and drivel that inevitably follows tiers. Should you still wish for a shorter form writeup on what the units are like, [consider checking the Ko-Fi posts here](https://ko-fi.com/ywisguides#).  
Whatever the case and however you choose to read this guide, I want to stress this - ALL units are viable, SOME are better than others, NONE of them will work if you don't know how to use them.
Good reading, and godspeed cap'n!
## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
 
  
  
### Evaluation Criteria:
- Ships are evaluated by their PvE PERFORMANCE first and foremost, but notes on notable PvP usage will be made if suitable.
- Ships are evaluated according to their ability to act as a STAND-ALONE unit.
- Ships unable to evaluated the above criterion (eg. carriers as a whole, Vestal) are rated according to their ability to act as a SUPPORT unit; buffs/debuffs/aa/heals garner higher ranks than sheer damage output, especially during boss fights. See assorted notes for reasoning.
- Ships are compared to others in their OWN CLASS for tiering purposes; if two ships are have comparable stats and purpose, the least expensive one will be ranked higher.
- Ships are listed alphabetically and in order of nationality (USS -> HMS -> IJN -> KMS -> France -> Italy -> Russia).
- All units are assumed to be MAXED (ie. lv120, BiS gear, SL10 across the board). PRs are an exception, as they take at the very least two full months to max, let alone rainbow ones.
- Auto or Manual performance is not taken into consideration, unless it is specifically relevant to the unit.
- The Retrofit Priority List orderings are decided on the basis of how effective is the retrofitted unit, not how much does it need the retrofit; in other words, the better (more powerful/more useful) the retrofit, the higher it is.
  
  
  
#### Role Explanations:
- The Role field seeks to explain at a glance what's the purpose of a unit, how it should be employed, and how does it compare in those roles to other units in her hull class. A **bold** role means that should be the unit's main purpose; an absent role means the unit cannot be relied upon to perform said role at all.
- DPS can be Gun, Torp, Plane or Barrage focused, and can be Light / Below Average / Medium / Above Average / Heavy / Extreme.
- Tank can be Light / Medium / Heavy.
- AA can be either Carry (will spearhead the fleet's AA damage) or Support (will assist significatively to the fleet's AA damage but should not be expected to handle things on its own), with both having Light / Medium / Heavy variants.
- Support is too varied a field and thus simply references how the unit supports others via heals, buffs or debuffs.
- If you'd like to know individual numbers, feel free to ask me on Discord (or Issues if you truly must).

#### Retrofit/Kai Priority List and PRiority list:
- DD                  : Yuudachi* > An Shan* = Chang Chun* > Ayanami = Z23 > Laffey > Kagerou = Tanikaze = Z1 > Nicholas = Cassin/Downes > Javelin > Foxhound = Shiranui

#### Assorted notes:
- Read the VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE at the top.
- Gear isn't an afterthought; good units with bad gear fail where bad units with good gear succeed. Learn what's good and why [here](https://github.com/Meowrin/al-guides), and if you don't know the nicknames for the various pieces of gear, look [here](https://imgur.com/a/4wEvTQo).
- The 'loadout' listed under CV/L entries details the number of planes each unit gets; eg. Unicorn gets 3 Fighters / 0 Dive Bombers / 3 Torpedo Bombers.
- The asterisk next to a name in the Priority List means the Kai is tied to some sort of event and may not be available right now; also, if you do not see a name in it, it's because it is not worth prioritizing.
- No, Izumo isn't missing from the PRiority list. She's just worthless. More details on why [here](https://github.com/YourWaifuIsShip/Azur-Lane-Guides/blob/master/AL%20Untier%20Guide.md).
- If you're wondering why carriers are judged differently from the rest, consider the following - they have no self-defence capabilities against suicide boats and are inherently worse than big guns at handling hard targets due to ordnance scatter and unhelpful anti-Heavy modifiers, but their AoE damage dispatches waves better than big guns usually do and come stock with screen clears.
tldr; BB/BC and CV/CVL do different things, holding them to the same standards makes little sense.
- **TIERLESS MEANS YOU NOW HAVE TO READ THE DESCRIPTIONS INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE IRRELEVANT ARBITRARY ACCURSED TIER NUMBERS. YOUR QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE UNIT IS FOUND IN THE ROLES FIELD. ENJOY.**
- **READ THE DAMN DESCRIPTIONS OR GHOSTLY HORSES WILL HAUNT YOU IN YOUR SLEEP.**

### DD ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/45px-DD_img40.png "DD Icon")
---
![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/Allen_M._SumnerChibi.png "Allen") - **[USS Allen M. Sumner](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Allen_M_Sumner)** 
* Roles:
  * **Medium AA carry, AA buffer, generalist DD**; light tank, high DPS (split between guns, torps and barrages).

* Skill:
  * Ignitions taken last -3s and deal +15% dmg to Light Armour. Every 20s, 70% chance to fire a [mixed barrage](https://streamable.com/97g703) and grant +20% AA to the entire fleet for 8s.
    * The 17 STARLETS deal 30 bdmg with 110/110/100 mods; the 5 TORPEDOES deal 101 bdmg with 80/100/130 mods. The starlets are modified by 100% of the unit's FP, the torpedoes by 100% of the unit's Torp. 
  * If sortied with 2+ USS units OR after Allen sinks 2+ enemies, gain +15% Torp/AA until the end of the battle. Upon equipping any piece of USS gear, gain a special ghost AA mount.
    * The ghost AA deals 142 bdmg at 100% AAEff, has 30 range and a 1.04s reload.

- Desc:
>The most accomplished flyswatter in her hull class, Allen shreds the skies with a prowess matched only by the higher end AA CL (and beaten only by the Trio of Flyer Doom, namely San Diego / Cheshire / Isuzu) while retaining solid DPS on the sea and a sturdy enough hull to weather the storms coming her way.  
As is customary for USS DD, neither her guns nor her torpedoes are particularly noteworthy and their lack of quality is made up by quantity, again in the form of the aforementioned barrages. Have care that they hit; given their somewhat wide pattern, that would be more likely on a mobbing fleet.  


![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/CassinKaiChibi.png "Cassin Kai") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/DownesKaiChibi.png "Downes Kai")- **[USS Cassin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Cassin#Retrofit)** **[USS Downes Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Downes#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * When HP falls under 20%, heals 25% of max HP once per battle
  * 60% chance to activate every 20 seconds, increase own Reload by 40% for 10 seconds

- Desc: The bubblewrap fights back!
>Packing a lot of Firepower for destroyers and blessed with a decent Reload buff to go along the excellent self-heal, Cassin and Downes may not have the monstrous damage output of their IJN counterparts but they can and will outlast them many times over.  
As it is for Phoenix, they are best used in mobbing fleets.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/Charles_AusburneChibi.png "Charles Ausburne") - **[USS Charles Ausburne](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Charles_Ausburne)**
* Roles:
  * **Part of the USS Fletcher Trio** (off-tank, secondary buffer).
 
* Skill:
  * 4% activation upon firing, increases Fleet movement speed, and Escort evasion by 40% for 8s
  * 60% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40% for 10s.

* Desc: 
>Another slippery little bastard, obsessed with justice and GOING FAST.  
Her torps are fairly worthless, but her guns are decent and her skill is absolutely amazing - not only does she increase your whole frontline's survivability, she also fixes whatever movement issues you might have at hand. The best DD friend your CAs could ever have.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/CooperChibi.png "Smoltimore") - **[USS Cooper](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Cooper)**
* Role:
  * Dedicated ASW DD.
  
* Skill:
  * Every 20s, gain +15% FP, reveal all enemy submarines for 10s and launch an ASW airstrike; also, if equipped with PBY-5A Catalina and HP falls below 40%, launch a special airstrike. Only works once for battle.
    * (20s Airstrike) The 1 BOMB deals 84 bdmg w/ 100/50/20 armour modifiers. The damage is modified by 100% of Cooper's ASW stat.
    * (Spc Airstrike) The 4 BOMBS deal 456 bdmg w/ 70/105/125 armour modifiers. The damage is modified by 120% of Cooper's Torp stat.
  
- Desc: 
>Fairly competent ASW DD with the same jack-of-all-trades-ish statline most USS DD get, plus a minor FP boost; as per usual, it makes for a decently rounded performance with relatively good AA to boot.  
Make no mistake, though, her main job is ASW: and in that regard she's fortunate not to have to use a sonar to reveal submarines, an aux slot that may be filled with a Catalina if you wish to give her some more ASW prowess and/or a sucker punch to whatever managed to drop her HP low enough (an unlikely prospect, and an unwanted one to boot). The regular ASW airstrike is just a single Catalina dropping one bomb, so expect little from it.  
Meme but alright.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/EldridgeChibi.png "Pikachu")- **[USS Eldridge](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Eldridge)**
* Roles:
  * Dead PvP meme. Still annoying.

* Skill:
  * Upon taking damage, 15% chance to make entire escort fleet to evade all attacks for 10s. DoT and Ramming damage still apply. CAN'T PROC BEFORE 20s HAVE PASSED (skill starts on cooldown).

* Desc: 
>Slippery little bastard, despite her CA-like movement speed. Her offensive stats are somewhat lacklustre, but she makes up for it with her skill - it might be RNG and her high Evasion works against it, but 10s of invulnerability is nothing to scoff at. Make sure to have her eat weak shots to minimise exposure to danger.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/FletcherChibi.png "USS Fletcher") - **[USS Fletcher](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Fletcher)**
* Roles:
  * **Part of the USS Fletcher Trio** (as flagship buffer).

* Skill:
  * Increases Firepower and Evasion of all Fletcher-Class in fleet by 30%
  * Increases Firepower, Torpedo, and Reload of DDs in the fleet by 10%

* Desc: 
>Lynchpin of the Fletcher Trio, think of her as an USS Z1 with a greater focus on gunnery as opposed to torps, as befitting her nation's doctrine. Very solid and dependable, but obviously better with other Fletchers.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/IngrahamChibi.png "Allen") - **[USS Ingraham](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Ingraham)** 
* Roles:
  * **Medium AA carry, AA buffer, generalist DD**; light tank, minor healer, above average DPS (split between guns, torps and barrages with a slant towards torpedoes).

* Skill:
  * 3s after the start of the battle and every 20s afterwards...
    *  Fire a special barrage.
    *  Spawn two stationary shields blocking up to 10 hits.
    *  Heal the vanguard with the lowest HP by 0.5% of its max HP thrice over 10s.
    *  Grant +15% AA to the fleet for 10s.
  * Gain AA equal to 50% of the unit's Torpedo stat (after equipment). Take -15% Ignition damage. Heal by 1% of her max HP every 15s.

- Desc: MCH represent.
>A tinkerer at heart, Ingraham proclaims her love for toolboxes by throwing a whole lot of bits of skills in your general direction. Not all of it lands.  
While it's easy to mistake all that stuff for liquid gold, only the barrage and the AA portions of her kit are particularly worthy of note - the heals are very minor, the Ignition protection accomplishes predictably little since vanguards are rarely subject to high power BB fires, and the shields are garbage as ever.  
On the other hand Ingraham's got the excellent AA mount Sumner does, and unlike Sumner she can load up on Oxygen Torpedoes (almost) guilt-free thanks to the Torp to AA conversion, thus preserving her damage output while demolishing planes with ease.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/LaffeyKaiChibi.png "Gun Bun") - **[USS Laffey Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Laffey#Retrofit)**
* Roles:
  * **Notorious DPS machine** (very high Reload). Deceptively flimsy.

* Skill:
  * 5% activation upon firing, increases own FP, Reload, and Evasion by 40% for 8s.
  * Every 20 seconds, has a 70% chance to active Vanquish Mode, increasing own Reload stat by 200% for 10 seconds and releasing a powerful barrage.

- Desc: Vorpal Bunny.
>While pretty good to begin with, once Kai'd Laffey truly stands out thanks to CL-tier amounts of Firepower and Efficiency coupled with absurd amounts of Reload, allowing her to akimbo gun down any fool standing in her way. Her torpedoes also come out much quicker than anyone else's, but given the lacking nature of US torps spamming them is one of the few ways to keep them relevant.  
The DPS monster to AyaKai's DPH.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/MauryChibi.png "USS Maury") - **[USS Maury](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Maury)**
* Skill:
  * 40% chance every 10s to raise evasion by 60% for 8s
  * Upon launching torpedoes, 30% chance to launch a second spread

* Desc: 
>Good double torpedoes and merely okay guns? On my USS DD? It's more likely than you think.  
Maury does things differently from many of her colleagues, but she does them well - despite not quite reaching the torp heights of the IJN or the gunnery of the KMS, she strikes a comfortable balance between the two factions and proves a reliable, independent addition to most fleets.


![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/NicholasKaiChibi.png "Nicholas Kai") - **[USS Nicholas Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Nicholas#Retrofit)**
* Role:
**Part of the USS Fletcher Trio** (as main tank and main DPS).

* Skill:
  * 5% chance upon firing to +40% her own Evasion and -40% damage received from planes for 8s
  * 60% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower for 8s
  * 70% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower/Torpedo/Reload for 10s and, once per battle, if an escort ship's Health falls below 20%, decrease the damage it takes by 15%. If the ship is Helena, additionally heal 8% of Helena's max Health

- Desc:
>Nicholas is a rarity among destroyers, in that she boasts both enough Firepower to face off with the best in her class and very solid defensive capabilities; a true generalist, even more so than Laffey considering her actually good torpedoes.  
With no real weakness on display, beyond simply not being quite as good as more specialised units, Nicholas is a worthy addition in pretty much any escort fleet - especially one with Helena or Fletcher.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/AmazonKaiChibi.png "HMS Amazon Kai")- **[HMS Amazon Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Amazon#Retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * Allied DDs in the fleet gain +18% experience.
  * Upon battle start and for 80s afterwards, deal +15% damage, take -8% damage and reduce the damage taken by allied DDs by -12% damage.
  * Has AAGM+1.

* Desc: 
>Nobody truly expected this to happen, but somehow Amazon's Kai turned out to be... somewhat alright!  
Certainly as an AA barge at least, whenever her double AA mount is allowed to do work, but she's also alright in terms of DPS and staying power; still, her niche is of questionable relevance so it's unlikely she'll see much use, but worth keeping in mind nonethless.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/EskimoChibi.png "Pingu") - **[HMS Eskimo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Eskimo)**
* Role:
  * **Light self-healing DD tank**, medium DD Gun DPS, below average DD Torp DPS.
  
* Skill:
  * Every 30s, launch a special [barrage](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742730234893172796/742730440154152960/Eskimo-Barrage.gif); upon falling below 30% HP, heal 10% of max HP back and launch a special barrage (only one proc per battle). Those barrages are the same.
    * The 17 shots deal 24 bdmg with 100/100/100 armour mods. They are modified by 100% of the unit's FP.

- Desc: 
>Finally, a competent enough HMS DD! Sure, her staying power is somewhat questionable if exposed to heavy fire and its damage output is just alright, but a self-heal is always appreciated and if you main HMS, you don't really get to be picky with your DD choices.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/JavelinKaiChibi.png "Javelin Kai") - **[HMS Javelin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Javelin#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Evasion by 60% for 8s.
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost torpedo stat by 30% for 8s.

* Desc: 
>While her starter version is pretty much undeniably the worst out of the three, the Kai does her some justice. Still nowhere as powerful as Ayanami or Laffey, but the EX barrage helps to close the gap to some extent... alas, the Evasion boost still accomplishes little due to powerful diminishing returns the stat incurs, with little to show for it.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/JervisChibi.png "Jarpiss") - **[HMS Jervis](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Jervis)**
* Roles: **(full) Vanguard Super-Heavy tank**, vanguard healer, HMS DD buffer. Middling DPS, torp-focused.

* Skill:
  * Gain +10% FP/ASW. If there are 3+ HMS units in the fleet, grant all HMS DD +10% FP, Torp, ASW. Once 20s have elapsed since the start of the battle, heal the vanguard by 5% of their max HP.
  * Take -10% Aviation damage. If the vanguard only consists of DD and/or CL, gain +10% Torp and take -20% Torp damage. Upon battle start, if there are 3 units in the vanguard and Jervis is leading it, damage taken has a 15% chance to increase her EvaRate by +30% for 10s (on a 20s cooldown).

* Desc: Helloooooo nurse.
>While it is true that prevention is better than cure, Jervis knows that having both is better than either - and that's exactly what she brings, in the form of a supremely tanky frame and a reliable, fairly potent vanguard heal.  
The incredible staying power is the true star of the show here, granting her a survivability only rivaled by the notorious and desperately obsolete Chinawall - or, for a more modern example, Agir - with just one minor caveat, namely having to field a full vanguard and ensuring they live. Neither is particularly hard, but it's definitely easier in a boss fleet - however, her middling damage output may prove a liability there.  
Less important are the DD buffs, as Royal Navy DD are quite the sorry bunch and the only competitive one is, well, Jervis. At least she'll benefit from her own skill.  

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/AyanamiKaiChibi.png "Ayanami Kai") - **[IJN Ayanami Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Ayanami#Retrofit)** 
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Torpedo by 60% for 8s
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost Evasion stat by 30% for 5s

* Desc: Nuclear Launch Detected.
>Ayanami is the last word in Torp Damage - with her skill procced, the damage she can inflict with them is completely unrivaled and, with enough buff stacking, can even reach the tens of thousands.  
On the flip side, Torpedoes are all she's got and once she's blown her load, she won't have much to do except waiting for them to come back online; and given how massively overkill her torpedoes tend to be, it would be advisable to deploy her in boss fights first, foremost and only.  
The DPH monster to LafKai's DPS.

#### ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/HanazukiChibi.png "Hanazuki") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/HarutsukiChibi.png "Harutsuki") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/YoizukiChibi.png "Yoizuki")- **[IJN Hanazuki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Hanazuki)** **[IJN Harutsuki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Harutsuki)** **[IJN Yoizuki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Yoizuki)**
* Role:
  * AA support, light hybrid DPS with solid staying power.

* Skill:
  * When planes are shot down within the AA circle, +25% own AA and Firepower for 8s.

- Desc:
>New-and-improved Niizukis, now with half the clothing and a better AA skill. While DDs aren't particularly good at AA, they do get Main Gun +1 and their skill actively encourages hunting those planes down. Decent even when planes aren't around, better when there are and surprisingly tough.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/HibikiChibi.png "Hibiki") - **[IJN Hibiki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Hibiki)**
* Skill:
  * Upon launching a torpedo spread, 30% chance to launch a second one; also, once per fight upon falling below 20% HP, heal back up by 20%.
  * If sortied with any other Akatsuki-class DD (Akatsuki, Inazuma, Ikazuchi), gain +15% FP/Torp/Reload.
  * Every 20s, 30% chance to lower an enemy's Reload by -30% and Damage by -15% for 10s (targets humanoid ships first).

* Desc: IJN Mahan!
>The IJN finally gets in on the self-healing action, and it does so in its own peculiar - read, torp-heavy and guns-light - way.  
An interesting proposition but one that is for the most part only going to appeal to dedicated torp-heavy vanguards, as the Mahans are much cheaper and much more effective in their role of unshiftable-yet-adequately-armed bubblewrap, but she can be put to good use if one is willing to manual and invest on torp buffers.  
Forget about the self-buff if sortied with Akatsuki-class DDs, they aren't worth using in the first place unless you particularly like them.  

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/KagerouKaiChibi.png "Lil Miss Paperbag") - **[IJN Kagerou Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Kagerou#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * Grant +15% Torpedo to the entire vanguard.
  * Upon launching a torpedo spread, 30% chance to launch a second one.
  * Every 20s, 30% chance to lower an enemy's Reload by -30% and Damage by -15% for 10s (targets humanoid ships first).

* Desc: 
>Widely available early on and blessed with both excellent skills and a very solid statline, Kagerou has a place in every torp-heavy frontline (torp-CA in particular, as they typically do not have access to torpedo buffs). Her Kai is more of a slight upgrade than a massive change, with her skill being middling at best, but the extra stats are appreciated nonetheless.

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/KazagumoChibi.png "Small Hands Gumo") - **[IJN Kazagumo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Kazagumo)**
* Roles:
  * **Strong CV/L cheerleader, torpedo spammer**. High torpedo DPS.

* Skill:
  * Gain +5% Torp and +15% Reload; also, whenever this unit launches her regular barrage, take 3s away from the unit's torpedo cooldown.
  * Grant +15% damage to CV/L (DOES NOT STACK with the generic +15% damage to CV/L skill). Upon firing the 4th torpedo spread, heal the CV/L with the lowest HP by 10% of its max HP, and if the flagship is a CV, the unit will be healed by +15% of its max HP instead.

* Desc: *Ey, I'm torpin' 'ere!*
>A cut above most other CV/L cheerleaders and considerably more reliable than most other IJN Torp-DDs, owing to her very solid statline and torpedo spread acceleration gimmick. Burst damage is good and all, but sometimes you'd rather just pop more than pop harder - and mob fleets tend to be carrier territory more so than big guns'.  
Her regular barrage is also fairly ideal for the task and is the main incentive for using accelerators such as the usual 120x1 or 76x1, dealing fairly significant damage on [a linear, reasonably narrow](https://gyazo.com/a02b1d4b0388a01dec99ebadfc105362) pattern.  
Don't ask about the Brooklyn accent. Blame Littorio's mistress.

  * Her torpedoes always deal 115% damage against all targets, regardless of the normal torpedo modifiers (80/100/130)

* Desc: Black Not Shooter.
>A veritable turncoat of a DD, Kawakaze's main purpose is making Light Armoured units' lives hell by drilling right through it with her torps and her stellar torpedo-armed barrage - and she accomplishes it beautifully.  
Terrifyingly effective against her intended targets, to the point of overtaking even Ayanami Kai - but she does still lose to her when faced with Heavy Armour, against which her skill puts her at a disadvantage.

  * 10s after the start of the battle, launch a torpedo barrage and take -6% damage for 50s; also, upon hitting with 8 NON-BARRAGE torpedoes, launch the same torpedo barrage.
  * Deal +15% dmg to Sirens.
  * Has MGM+1.

* Desc: 
>Always liked the Akizuki-class's DDakka and disliked their lack of anything resembling proper firepower?  
Well, look no further, for Kitakaze dispenses with the flimsy pretense of being an AA DD like the others and goes all-in on surface weaponry - from the supercharged twinned DD gun rocking high FP and Eff with fixed 115% modifiers across the board to the solid regular/barrage torpedo suite, Kitakaze is more than capable of taking on any sort of foe and coming out on top handily (helped also by her exceptionally high HP).  
Fits any comp, is downright murderous against Heavy. Brilliant.

  * 10s after the start of the battle, launch a torpedo spread; every 20s afterwards and on a 25% chance, launch a torpedo spread. The torpedoes' power and amount are the same as that of those currently equipped.
  * Upon battle start, if Naganami is sortied in the middle of a full vanguard, grant +15% Torp and +10% Torp CritRate to DD/CL and +15% Eva to DDs.

* Desc: 
>By and large an alternative to Kagerou Kai, as their statlines are almost identical but their focus differs slightly.  
Whereas Kagerou Kai buffs the entire vanguard regardless of amount of members and hull class, CAs included, Naganami buffs DD/CL more (and especially DDs, though the +Eva is mostly negligible on units with such a high Eva stat already); the 'free' torpedo spreads aren't as reliable as the Chain Torpedo Kagerou brings, as they are timer-based rather than on-launch, but are still fairly good.

Do fret, however, about her consistency; while she's nowhere near as unreliable as her fellow IJN self-healer, Hibiki, her impresssive DPS still does come down in significant part to the barrages, and without manual control (which is recommended anyway, this being a DD and all) they may fire off at inopportune times or inopportune places.

Well, no more of that now! The old Kancolle darling got a significant makeover by way of doubling and improving those guns she had no way to appropriately use before, despite the FP boost; and speaking of boosts, don't be fooled by the reduced potency on the first skill as the gained consistency **and** the huge +15% damage boost vs Ignited targets more than make up for it.  
On a less relevant note, but still welcome, she also got somewhat tougher and can boost torp vanguards meant for early boss/siren deletions.

Not entirely unlike a few other DDs, most of Z2's DPS comes straight from her barrage rather than anything else; unlike them, however, this is by design and both her skills reinforce that notion, meaning she's at her best when manually controlled and firing non-stop and on the backfoot when she's not.

Very similar in behaviour to her USS counterpart, but whereas she can run a one-bunny show thanks to her Kai statline and skills, Z35 needs Z1's presence to really compare; and while she won't be matching her anytime soon, she'll still be giving many other DDs a run for their money.

The tempo she forces upon you is fairly demanding, as the average DD torpedo set reloads in 21-22s and that leaves you precious little time to position yourself for an attack run at full power, but if you can keep up the DPS is fairly remarkable; if you can't, however, you'll be stuck with middling efficiencies and no buff to rescue them.

Proud owner of a quick-firing, high-volume, AP conal barrage with four homing torpedoes to the side that is boosted both by her own +APdmg skill (only use the recently released golden KMS DD AP gun or stick with the usual quick-firing solutions) and her high torp stat, she puts every other standard DD barrage in the game to shame and is the main reason for her remarkable prowess. That said, like most KMS DD, her normal torpedoes are pretty bad and will bank on her gunnery to pull through.

>A floating medkit with guns, Gromky's statline plays it straight with her nation's traits (tougher but less evasive hulls, strong guns, torpedoes so bad even Roon would laugh at them) and thankfully spices it up with a useful, if admittedly somewhat roundabout, vanguard heal.  
If you're taking her, that's the reason you're doing it - and it is a pretty good reason, if you're concerned about a vanguard dying on you and your backline's too busy DPSing to bring healers.

She can also be sortied solo with some success, but even with a defensive buff and a tough Soviet hull, she won't stand for *too* long without healing support and she'll be somewhat weaker than she'd otherwise be.

- Desc: L'incrociatore blu.
>Also known as the "Blue Cruiser", this Italian-born destroyer leader entirely deserves her moniker; her statline is hilariously stacked, with an eHP well capable of rivaling even the tough Cleveland-class light cruisers and a Firepower that actually overtakes them (to a not insignificant degree, when factoring both her Efficiencies and DD guns).  
The historical records are curiously silent on the subject of suspiciously familiar-looking guardian faeries, but one cannot fault her effectiveness nonetheless: for all the 50s she's active it puts out a shocking amount of DPS, roughly equivalent to that of a second gun mount backed by her stats, and also doles out a little bit of slows along the way (not too relevant, but it's better than nothing anyway).  
Impressive as she is, Tashkent does have a couple of drawbacks; first of all is her damage output, heavily slanted towards Light (both her ideal gun and the fairy have Normal DD ammo modifiers), and secondly is the simple fact her DPS does drop quite significantly once the fairy pops. While this does not exactly force her into a mob fleet role, it is nevertheless where she is bound to be most effectively deployed.

  * **Gunship DD (very high Gun DPS w/ Light focus, average Torp DPS)**; medium tank, minor carrier support.

* Skill:
  * Upon battle start, gain +10% FP and summon ~~Navi~~ an ice fairy for 50s, whose shots inflict a -5% Aviation Damage Taken debuff upon enemies hit by them 10 times.
    * The 6 ICICLES deal 24 bdmg with 100/50/20 modifiers and a 125% Coefficient; the icicles are fired every 2s in two three-icicle bursts, which can be aimed at two different targets.
  * For the first three battles of the sortie, gain +12% FP; for the fourth battle and onwards, gain +12% AA.

- Desc: A somewhat pallid imitation of the original.
>Musekent behaves almost exactly like the normal Tashkent while performing somewhat worse; the hefty extra Efficiency on the main guns is gone in favour of a fairly negligible carrier-minded debuff (potency is too low) and a FP boost that eventually melts away in favour of AA she can't actually use.  
Is she bad? No, she's still a Taskhent and this means she's still a beast with a few caveats. Is she worse than Tashkent? Yes.

The shielding prowess is her main and only thing, which is a bit unfortunate, as her staying power isn't much and neither is her DPS.  
Still, it's an interesting gimmick to have.

>Le Memin returns to the fore as an angelic idol while retaining the kit concept behind the original: very good gunnery, valuable if quirky support, middling torpedoes, excessive amounts of speed.  
The quirks are especially notable this time around, even if her moment-to-moment play doesn't change all that much. The 3s stops are the most notable item on the list, and are more of a boon than a detriment (will prevent ramming on auto and not slow the vanguard significantly); the mini-airstrikes she throws out are remisnescent of Shirakami Fubuki, with the same AA bypass and more bombs; the heals are somewhat more consistent and welcome, if not quite enough to sustain her under heavy fire.

    * The 45 FLOWERS deal 25 bdmg with 130/90/60 armour mods; the 5 TORPEDOES deal 45 bdmg with 80/100/130 armour mods. The FLOWERS pierce once. Each barrage component modified by 100% of their respective stat.
  * Gain +7 Speed. If there is another DD in the vanguard, gain +7 more Speed and +20% AA/Evasion; if there is NOT another DD in the vanguard, take -5% damage and gain +20% Reload.
  * AoA launch twice as quickly. Also, if she's the only DD in the vanguard, it launches on the 4th Main Gun firing cycle instead of the 5th.

- Desc:
> Speed memes, flower power and barrages out the wazoo! Le Terrible's one-kanmusu-show is rather impressive, for both good and ill.  
Starting with the good, she puts out a *lot* of barrages. Those barrages are backed by her robust statline and buffs that further bolster her gunnery slant; the main one is the FLOWER POWER burst, which is mostly suited to mob fleet fights because of its rather wide pattern (one half narrows down somewhat, the other goes to the sides), but the regular AoA shouldn't be discounted too quickly either.  
As for the bad... all that speed is mostly just detrimental on auto, as it leads to more involuntary ramming (and even more so if you bring other DDs - because you needed more speed with 2+ DD around clearly) and in turn more frequent stops at the dock for repairs. Whoops! Also unsurprisingly, her torpedoes are fairly weak.

  * When sortied as the Lead Ship, +20% Main Gun Efficiency and -30% AA Gun Efficiency.
  * AoA launch twice as quickly.

>One of the first not-KMS Gunship DD to be released, Triomphant more or less tries to emulate Laffey Kai's brrrt prowess by offering a very strong (if unstable on auto) Reload boost to go with the powerful (but narrow) AoA and the middling torpedoes, all backed by a solid statline emphasising her gunnery.  
On the flip side, her performance nosedives without manual control and she's more or less forced to be the Lead (-20% MGEff is a *steep* drop on her damage output, and her AA is nowhere near worth the trade).

>Despite the higher efficiency AA, slightly better torps and slightly worse guns, Libeccio's (and by extension Maestrale's) statline is more or less akin to Carabiniere's - meaning, tough little gunboat-ish thingies that are mostly reliant on their skills for relevance.  
In her case, it's a nifty barrage proccing on damage taken by anyone but her on a 15s cooldown with a wide pattern and pretty alright damage, meant for mob fleets more so than anything else. Decent utility.

Considering how often a vanguard gets pelted with sprinkles or the backline tickled by planes, when not accompanied by AA-capable units, the chances of it firing up are very high; the smokescreen is also worth a mention, not because it's good at its intended job (smokescreens never are) but because it can proc a lot faster, meaning you could realistically get some use out of them even on auto. Imagine that!

* Skill:
  * 5s after battle start and every 20s afterwards, inflict a -20% Accuracy debuff to every enemy on screen for 5s and drop a flare lasting 15s.
    * The flare deals 81 damage per second to enemies standing in it. The damage does not scale.
  * Gain a +5% FP/Torp stack per defeated enemy node by the fleet she's in, up to +15% FP/Torp; also, deal an increasing amount of damage with torps depending on proximity to the target (goes from +0% at 60 range to +15% at 10 range).
  * Has MGM+1 and can store only one torpedo spread. MLB perk is +30% aux stats.

* Desc: 
>The first gold Regia Marina DD comes out swinging, armed to the teeth with a MGM+1, high FP (by MGM+1 DD standards) and strong torpedoes (especially when shotgunned)... and also the potential to make CL feel insecure about their HP pool, if you so desire.  
Her MLB perk allows her to be built effectively in a variety of ways, according to your needs: as mentioned above you may bulk up her HP pool for tanking purposes, or you may take FP auxiliaries to lean further into the gunnery, or better yet (if you're feeling up to manual play) give her rainbow torpedoes to maximise the power of her torpedoes.  
As for the skills, the ramping FP/Torp buff solidly cements her role as a mob fleet mainstay while the flare is mostly useful as a temporary defence boost for your fleet; the damage it deals is very low and does not scale, so expect very little from that front. On the other hand her AOA picks up the slack, but is not particularly worth chasing after with rapid DD guns due to the MLB perk.

>And so did the gimmicks. But oh, how sweet these gimmicks are!  
Whereas before they were standard fare Russian DDs (strong guns, tough hulls, high speed, abysmal torpedoes), now they slug it out with the best and ~~biasedest~~ brightest DD stars out there, courtesy of their MGM+1 and now-actually-functional secondary weapons, in the form of missiles, allowing them to not only shred Light Armour but also threaten the rest on the field and soften up enemy mob nodes on the map.
Their barrage game also improved significantly, with their upgraded AOA firing more often and dealing more damage and the acquisition of a timed skill barrage, each slapping a somnwhat minor but not insignificant debuff on the enemies they hit (and the patterns are wide enough to make hits a guarantee).  
The main gimmick is perhaps the ability to turn into a backliner - interesting but less than desirable outside of niche scenarios, like cheesing stat requirements on Hardmodes, as they cannot really contest the firepower of actual BBs, including preloaders, and their carrier-like stealth still gets negated easily without AA coverage.
*About Anshan*... she's the solo player of the duo, for the most part. Used standalone she's far stronger and more likely to benefit from her own skill barrage, but will obviously improve with Changchun.
*About Changchun*... think of her as a vanguard Gangut, except she never stops firing at full force. She'll also buff Chinese units, but since there are none legitimately worth using beyond personal preference, it won't matter much.

>The first ever legitimately good collaboat, Not Kawakaze marries a typically IJN DD statline to a gushing love for modern military aircraft - so much so that she lugs a pair around instead of AA guns and has one swinging by every 20s to bomb her foes.  
The trade is a net positive. While two 80% Dive Bombers and 201 Aviation make for very weak airstrikes, she loses nothing of value (IJN AA is by and large terrible, and IJN DD AA is usually worst in hull class) for it while gaining some 'free damage' and, more importantly, a quick-firing screenclear no other vanguard in the game can claim to have; as for the other skills they're alright, somewhat low-impact but appreciated nonetheless.  
One can only hope we'll see more DDVs like this one in the future.

>Second best of the Cleveland-class, chiefly by virtue of... acknowledging their limits?
Ever since the game moved on from those early worlds (W8 or W9), the Clevelands have struggled to find their footing; CL guns, once preferred to CA guns because faster to reload and unlikely to overkill targets, are severely underpowered... as is their AA, when facing the nippon flying steel of W12 or swarms of W13.  
Biloxi does not actually solve these problems, but does mitigate them by doing away with those early low-proc skills like Full Firepower in favour of passive buffs; out of the two, the one most likely to aid is the +FP -AA, not least because the 127x2 is a fairly poor gun.

While the power of her debuff is unparalled, it's hard to make sure she will proc when you need her to - either because the enemy has died already or there's no worthy targets on the screen, as tends to happen on mob nodes, or because it just won't proc due to bad luck; only boss fights tend to drag on for long enough to guarantee her debuff will proc and get some use, so long as you can make sure the fleet will be ready to strike when she does.  
Do not give her a SG Radar, as it will severely hinder your fleet's ability to exploit the burst windows Helena creates and the +10% Evasion barely makes up for the loss in Evasion she would suffer by not taking the usual PR Rudder.

>Another great entry in the ever-expanding roster of USS flyswatters, Reno is a dedicated AA CL sporting surprisingly high DPS - not too far off from a San Diego Kai in fact, which is no mean feat, especially against DD/CL - and an overwhelming urge to protect carriers.  
Most of her kit more or less revolves around carriers, in fact - she gains substantial boosts with them around and can defend them remarkably well with her boosted guns, an armour-modifiers-ignoring (100/100/100) barrage and a nifty damage reduction for the first few engagements she's in, something better suited to a mob fleet than a boss fleet.  
Wherever there are planes to shred and carriers to protect, Reno is at home - and the more there is of both, the better.

You'll still want to give her an Oxygen Torpedo or two, though - her torp stat remains abysmal, and even if it's not the torps you're taking her for there's no reason to let them rot. Besides, fireworks go great with a nice, starry night.

That said, the recent introduction of a CL HE gun that deigns itself to fire *straight* singlehandedly makes her considerably more combat-effective, if still lacking in support power.  
Her place is mostly PvP, as there are many other CL who will do what she does - be it DPS or tanking - better for less.

Nevertheless, she and her less fortunate sisters have always been the HMS answer to Isuzu and alas, they're not really - their DPS is abysmal owing to a poor statline to back the DD guns, and the AA suite is far from good enough to compete with their IJN rival (let alone the USS one).

> It was to be expected that the Dido-class flagship would be good; what was not expected is that she'd also make Queen Elizabeth not terrible anymore (still not a first pick though, alas; her base statline is too poor to be fixed *that* easily).  
As a standalone unit, she's an overall improved Sirius: the barrage is more powerful and easier to land, the statline is better across the board, the AA is actually good-to-excellent this time around and the buffs she gets are very significant, more so than those she grants.  
On the flipside, the buffs can be unwieldy: while the Dido+3HMS requirements is easily filled and so is taking the chimpanQE along, exploiting the Dido-class buff will result in at least *someone* not getting to use part of their kit (Dido would want QE, Sirius wants carriers, Black Prince wants 1 USS unit).

>A fairly standard Dido-class CL, she comes with the expected solid-but-unremarkable DD gun DPS, passable AA and atrocious torpedoes.  
As a Dido-class, the barrages should be the main attraction here... except they're implemented in just about the stupidest way possible: the arcing, short-range barrage only fires when she's 30+ units away from any enemy, meaning she has to gingerly skirt the edge of the 30-35 units mark for it to fire (no guarantee of it landing on target either), whereas the non-conditional one just fires straight... which doesn't mesh with the supposed aiming on the arcing barrage.  
It's a mess, but if you actually do jump through the hoops she forces you to, the damage *is* there and it's *mostly* worth it.

No? Well me neither, but there she is anyway.  
To be clear, Gloucester isn't a bad CL: she's on par with your average HMS CL, in fact, which is a fairly good place to be in, and taking her will not hamper your progress... however, the usefulness of that skill is a matter of fierce debate.
As the common method of dealing with the Out of Ammo thing is to have a comp capable of handling those multiple fights, usually reliant on healing of some sort, in order not to take casualties and potentially reduce overall costs; Gloucester's skill grows 'stronger' the more units you take, however, which is something you'd rather avoid in a mob fleet because the costs would increase.  
She's in a weird position, all in all, and whether you'll take her or not will most likely depend on whether you find her skill useful; she's good enough to pull her own weight, either way, and that's good enough.

>The other HMS answer to Phoenix, and... just as the other (Neptune), unable to truly upstage her despite being pretty okay.  
What makes Phoenix so desirable is a combination of extreme reliability (all-gun setup), solid statline and low costs; Penelope loses that reliability by taking torpedoes, hindering her already lacking Torp-CL clearing power, resulting in more frequent occurrences of ramming enemies and taking severe damage in the process.  
This is less of a concern on manual play, naturally, and on the bright side the self-heal comes with a considerable temporary damage reduction; this may come in handy should she be exposed to particularly heavy burst damage (or ramming things).  
Remember that boosting her torpedoes with Oxytorps will cut into her survivability, so handle with care.

>Similar in a few ways to Jintsuu, Sirius offers a spectacular buff to a specific subset of units while benefiting greatly from it herself - significant enough to offset her otherwise unimpressive statline and really get the most out of her DD guns.
Gunnery is her main asset, and her barrage even more so - one of the absolute best as far as vanguards are concerned, very quick and hard-hitting despite the unassuming Normal shells, and unique in its narrowing pattern, which makes landing most of the shots from long range a rather simple task.  
That said, you will need to deploy a few carriers to get the full experience and with her barrage making up a significant portion of her overall DPS, her auto performance will suffer - handle with care.

>Isuzu's retrofit went a long way towards cementing her position as the strongest solo AA powerhouse in the game, while also bolstering her thin hull - and giving her something to do when her monstrous AA isn't actually needed, in the form of some sizeable buffs to weapon efficiencies and some free torpedoes.  
The 'assault mode' she goes into when taking non-IJN guns raises her DPS to fairly respectable levels, roughly on par with your average HMS CL, while also bringing down her AA to less obscene levels (which are still considerably higher than most of the competition's).  
That said, Isuzu Kai's main calling is that of the AA monster; it's nice you can now use her outside of that one role, but you have better DPS options. Consider her if you need significant AA on top of some DPS.

Sporting three different superb torpedo buffs for whoever has any business mounting them and stellar torpedo stats+efficiency, she's a powerhouse in her own right with access to a handy damage cut (which she needs, considering her abysmal HP pool) and an uncharacteristically good barrage.  
With no real weakness to speak of beyond a somewhat flimsy hull, her one significant flaw is not being able to bolster CA torpedoes - you'll want to look elsewhere for that.

One of the absolute toughest units in the entire game, regardless of hull class; astounding supportive capabilities in general and especially for torp-heavy comps; high DPS thanks to the torpedo/crit buffs, IJN standard high quality torpedoes and unusually decent guns; and a nice barrage to cap it all off, like she needed the extra help or something.  
About the only flaw she has, if we're feeling nitpicky, is not being as helpful to gun-heavy comps as some other cruisers, but... for everyone else that does happen to have torpedoes, you'll want her specifically.

If sortied without the IJN DD half her kit wants to buff, she's a very solid torpedo platform with a minor AA presence and a strong barrage; if sortied with them, she gains a pretty decent heal and grants alright buffs to DDs (useless AA boost notwithstanding).   
Personal recommendation: she's better off without the DDs overall, and the DDs have better supporters to rely on.

"yes"  
Clever (very) implementation as a character - if hampered by the characterisation - aside, Emden launches as a strong and quite unique offering for German fleets. Depending on her choice of secondary weapon, she plays either as a powerful damage dealer and slower or a reliable tank, while granting the rest of her fleet a nifty FP boost. Convenient!
One minor thing to bear in mind for manual play is her inability to store two torpedo spreads, as she reloads both tubes in a single cooldown. This increases her damage output with the things far beyond the terrible efficiency and low Torp stat, but there can be that to keep in mind.

> Clearly inspired by the popular and very capable Zara, this former Admiral Hipper hull does away with the predecessor's CA guns and revolving shields in favour of more CL guns and the much superior single front-facing style of hitshields... which, uniquely, also happen to shoot back as they are inevitably broken. While frailer than Zara's and slower to respawn, by virtue of triggering a barrage when broken they are also more universally useful: hitshields have a deservedly poor reputation for breaking far too quickly to incoming enemy fire that would have dealt little to no damage anyway, and this provides an elegant solution to the issue.  
Shielding aside, Mainz shows some versatility in use, gaining more bulk and speed if set as vanguard lead or more damage output if placed elsewhere; given how ubiquitous CL or CA tanks are (and how rare Gun-CL capable of actual DPS are), it would be better to have her off-tank and let her rip.

    * Regular Ignitions stack with this Ignition and deal damage as if she were not Ignited.
  * 10s after battle start and every 20s afterwards, grant every vanguard unit a personal shield.

>Setting yourself on fire usually isn't a great way to start a fight, but apparently Jeanne d'Arc - this one, at least - never got the memo. Or maybe it's *holy* fire and that's what lets her get considerably stronger while she's blazing?  Anyway.  
Jeanne d'Arc one-ups Sheffield in the 'vanguard protector' role, as her shields apply to every ship regardless of HP and are proper shields instead of a damage reduction, meaning at least some damage will be blocked entirely; better yet, if the personal shields were to break (as they are wont do during enemy bursts), the subsequent 2s of invulnerability let those units evade even more damage.  
The heal on shield expiration is nice too, but hardly going to make a difference later on (they'll just break first, but DDs could still appreciate the help when the pressure is lower); the +HMS damage is a funny historical reference and about as relevant as the damage she takes from her immolation (a meagre 80 damage after 30s of battle, entirely negligible).

It's worth mentioning how the -1 Torpedo Speed is a very good thing, despite what it sounds like - torpedoes on manual tend to either be shotgunned or launched at relatively close range if HMS, and as such they are not negatively impacted, whereas torpedoes on auto more or less have to use KMS launchers to compensate for the AI's idiocy, at which point the slowdown considerably increases their hitrate by being unable to zoom past things.

As amazing as all this sounds, she is let down by one glaring flaw - her abysmal offensive statline, which even her impressive buff struggles to shore up, compounded with pre-WW1-era engines that grant her the questionable honour of being the slowest ship in the game (tied with Yat Sen).  
All that said, unlike Yat Sen she is certainly usable; okay-ish on her own and an amazing force multiplier, having her around won't cut into your DPS to the point of crippling your fleet and will help your other ships MvP.

The Ignitions are the same as her regular Ignitions, and therefore risk being overridden by stronger ones; still, free damage is free damage for as long as it lasts.

Someday regular units will get to enjoy this level of gimmicks (not), but for now, we deal with Rikka. Thankfully, that is a good thing, since Rikka is a very competent all-rounder CL meant to spam barrages all day long - possibly enhanced by the usage of her event aux, which also happen to grant her excellent equivalents to some of the best CL weaponry currently available.  
Giving her the correct aux is in most cases her intended usage, but if you're feeling brave (or memey) you can go and turbocharge some other stat with inordinate amounts of non-event aux, a favourite being rainbow torpedoes - this will be somewhat effective for the purpose at hand, mostly if applied to torpedoes, but will leave her without weapons on those repurposes slots. Beware.  
Lastly, she has a heal. It comes out too slowly to matter and its potency is negligible, but it's not nothing, so...

- Description: The Okay Wall of China.
>Obscenely slow (pre-Kai), pitiful HP and middling torps at best; Yat Sen is somewhat more interesting, with her double guns and twin AA mount, but her statline is severely lacking and has the questionable distinction of being tied with Avrora for slowest unit in the game.  
Nothing about these three looks usable, until you start deploying them together - at which point the sisters start evading better than basically anyone else in the game, even on the Single Line formation, achieveing unrivaled amounts of effective HP while dishing out respectable DPS besides.  
Lots of investment needed and Yat Sen MUST be protected at all costs (hint, place her between Ping and Ning), but they're the ultimate stonewall - if that's what you're looking for, it's worth it.

>Cursed to die over and over again in PvP due to her ludicrously powerful healing skill, which can on its own change the course of a fight, this poor girl has little to no place in PvE as you do NOT want your units to die there in the first place and her offensive power is lacklustre at best.

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/AnchorageChibi.png "Anchorage") - **[USS Anchorage](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Anchorage)** 
* Role:
  * **Toughest tank in the game as of writing (06/03/22)**; high Gun damage, average Barrage damage, low Torpedo damage.

* Skill: 
  * Gain +15% Evasion. Upon torpedo launch, 75% chance to launch a [forward barrage](https://patchwiki.biligame.com/images/blhx/f/f6/8sfvsgup3qe5wu2fibtwe5grrgh431b.gif); if the proc fails, the currently loading torpedo cooldown accelerates by 3s.
  * Upon torpedo launch, deploy a smokescreen *and* a barrier on Anchorage. The smokescreen lasts 5s and increases EvaRate on those inside by +40%, and the barrier lasts 5s and can absorb up to 6% of the unit's max HP. If the barrier is destroyed, gain +100% EvaRate for 2s.
    * The 16 CRYSTALS deal 40 bdmg with 135/95/70 amods, and have the CA standard 8% Ignition chance. They are modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * Deal +15% damage to Sirens.
  * Has MGM+1 and torpedoes. Awful torpedoes, so go ahead and use triples (or even duals, why not!)

* Desc: [oh no](http://memes.ucoz.com/_nw/10/71782030.jpg)
>Another superheavy tank joins the roster. Not sure we needed more, but there she is, and she's undoubtedly the hardest to shift unit in the entire roster so far. She manages to be this tough thanks to the passive Evasion boost, higher-than-usual HP pool, barrier-with-attached-invulnerability on breakage, and lastly the smokescreen (assuming the vanguard will stay in it, a big 'if' on manual).  
There is not much else to say about her, all her kit is eminently defensive and the barrage is more of a nice addition than a powerful offensive implement; the AOA is somewhat more effective in that regard, but still, dealing damage is not her main job.

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/BaltimoreChibi.png "Baltimore") - **[USS Baltimore](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Baltimore)** 
* Role:
  * **Very High Gun DPS (AP+-locked) and anti-Heavy Armour Break debuffer** , good USS carrier buffer and Light tank (w/ 2+ USS carriers), Medium tank (w/o USS carriers).

* Skill: 
  * Overrides Main Gun ammo with improved AP (85/120/85 modifiers).
  * If deployed with USS CV/L, grant them +7% AA and +15% Aviation; if sortied without, gain +12% FP and +15% Evasion.

* Desc: Baltimore AP Blues.
>Designed to take the fight to later worlds, Baltimore proves to be a tough hard-hitter in every situation; with or without USS carriers to augment she's nearly always at her best, all you have to do is make sure she's snacking on heavy cruisers and carriers or, at the very least, landing those pierces.  
Nevertheless, do try to have her around those USS carriers, as the buffs she grants them are more substantial than those she has for herself.

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/BremertonChibi.png "Bremerthot") - **[USS Bremerton](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Bremerton)**
* Role: 
  * **Very High Gun DPS, light AA carry and light tank (if not lead)**, medium tank (if lead).

* Skill: 
  * Upon Main Gun fire, 30% chance to deal +30% dmg for 3s (with 5s internal cooldown); also, 70% chance to fire a [special barrage](https://streamable.com/srnlj) (with 10s internal cooldown).
    * The 12 SHELLS deal 20 bdmg with 135/95/70 armour modifiers. The damage is modified by 100% of Bremerton's FP. IT DOES NOT IGNITE, despite what the skill text says.
  * Upon battle start and if deployed as vanguard lead, take -20% dmg for 30s; if not deployed as lead, gain +25% AA until the end of the battle.

* Desc: Warrior of Likes.
>Another excellent showing from the Baltimore-class, Bremerton brings impressive amounts of AA fire from a Heavy Cruiser without compromising staying power or damage output in the process.  
Sharing the same high-end gunship CA statline of her sister Baltimore (with the notable exception of the enhanced AA, a staggering 140% Efficiency), Bremerton can roughly dish out and take the same punishment of her sibling - with the crucial difference that Bremerton may mount either HE or AP guns and have her damage boost fill the gap between the two's anti-Medium performance, whereas Baltimore is locked into AP shelling.  
Depending on where you place her, Bremerton can either be a vanguard tank or a light AA carry; in all likelihood she'll be fulfilling the former role until W12+, where the heavy plane presence and tough enemies warrant both her firepower and AA.
One last note - despite what her skill description says, the special barrage DOES NOT ignite targets. No biggie, the damage would've been minimal anyway, but unfortunate.

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/ChicagoChibi.png "Chicago") - **[USS Chicago](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Chicago)**
* Roles:
  * **Extreme Gun DPS.**

* Skill: 
  * Upon firing the Main Gun, 30% chance to have it deal +100% Damage. (Has an internal cooldown of 5s; do not give her the 203Mle as the gun will reload in under 5s.)

* Desc: 
>The quintessential Glass Cannon, Chicago is deceptively fragile (being one of the poster girls for 'CAs not necessarily being tanks') and unassumingly devastating due to the maths involved in her skill - if she procs on her first salvo, the buff affects the second one too, meaning that that all in all her actual double damage procrate is 49%!  
Give her a decent gun, stick someone in front to take hits for her and she'll cut through the opposition like butter at a very modest 10 Oil price tag.

  * 20% chance upon Main Gun fire to gain +100% Eva for 15s.

- Desc: Problem? What problem?
> While an Evasion-focused CA sounds ludicrous, and it is under most circumstances, Houston actually makes it work given enough Evasion-boosting auxiliaries: CAs live and die by their Evasion (or lack thereof), so stacking it actually lets her survive under heavy fire for much longer than you'd expect.  
What issues she does have are fairly minor: she needs to proc to get tough, obviously, but her uptime is high and she has two chances to proc per firing cycle; and her damage output isn't as high as it could be, since her only skill is that Evasion buff, but it's still higher than most non-CA (and many Torp-CA) frontliners manage.

 ![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/MinneapolisChibi.png "USS Minneapolis") - **[USS Minneapolis](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Minneapolis)**
* Roles:
  * **Heavy Self-Healing Tank**, High Gun DPS.

  * +15% Firepower and +30% Reload for 12s after killing an enemy vessel, if skill is already active it will refresh the duration 
  * When Minneapolis' HP falls under 30%, lose 2 Speed but gain -10% damage sustained and heal 4% HP every 3s for 16s (can only proc once per fight).

- Desc: Monster Hunter. Je suis monté.
> Upgunned, uparmoured, upskilled and, alas, upcosted. In most regards, Minneapolis is indeed a direct step-up from Phoenix: her CA guns massively overpower her predecessor's CL ones, the Medium Armour cuts incoming gunfire damage in half, the heal is somewhat slower but comes with a handy damage resistance buff... but it's the +FP/Rld buff when taking enemies down that's the real deal and kicks her DPS into really high gear, as long as there's targets for her to take down.

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/PortlandKaiChibi.png "Portland Kai") - **[USS Portland Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Portland#retrofit)**
* Roles:

She won't hit as often as Wichita or as hard as Chicago, but she's cheap, damn hard to kill and consistent.

  * Gain +10% Evasion and AA. Also, depending on which vanguard position she occupies...
    * IF LEAD or SOLO, gain +5% Eva/AA and take -15% damage from all sources.
    * IF MIDDLE, heal all vanguard units by 10% of their max HP after 20s from the start of the battle.
    * IF REAR, gain +15% FP and +10% AA, and boost vanguard damage dealt by +10%.

* Desc: 
>A *real* case study in versatility at a time when ammo-swapping shenanigans are considered the epitome of flexibility (when they're often just a detriment), San Franisco offers something of worth under most, if not all, circumstances - a very welcome notion and superbly executed, further reinforced by her gold USS CA standard statline.  
Out of the three modes, the ones most likely to see use are the DPS-rear or the Tank-front; the former for self-explanatory reasons, as she's already strong and gets much stronger as she settles in the back, and the latter because her survivability skyrockets past even some of the toughest tanks around (to the point it is kind of excessive most of the time).

I am not sure this was an improvement, but nevermind the bollocks; the comparison between the two is fairly apt, as both fulfil rather similar roles as mobile no-fly zones while putting out respectable-to-good DPS. Whereas San Diego shreds Light Armour better, Cheshire takes over against other types; and where San Diego's supportive capabilities come mainly in the form of a massive fleetwide AA buff, Cheshire's more or less boils down to taking lots of hits and chugging along regardless, helped in that by the Medium armour and the +Eva stacks.

No flashy mechanics to show off or imaginative barrages to spew, just really powerful guns bolstered by excellent forced modifiers, stats stacks and a minor self-heal that'll help her keep going through the fights (to an extent). Her ghost guns get a buff too; welcome, but they don't really get to the point where they pose a significant threat.  
That's pretty much it, really. A devastating powerhouse of a Gun-CA with some poor torpedoes to the side and a little heal, and... not much else.

>London's retrofit is on a one-town-mission to clear the bad rap HMS CA for the most part deservedly get, and good Lord does she put in the effort.  
While her base form has never been bad, performing as well as a Leander Kai at the end of the day, her comparatively high costs and mostly irrelevant niche (buffing DD FP as well as the rest) meant she wouldn't see much use; the Kai does not change this, but it does put her DPS in the big leagues thanks to her new obscenely powerful DD mount and chance for double damage, while the stat gains make her considerably tougher beside; the +Acc stacks are nice but not particularly important as vanguards don't really struggle landing hits but more crits are appreciated nonetheless.  
Given all this, London Kai proudly joins Wichita and Choukai in their exclusive "best and most useful CA club" and does so with finesse.

York Kai is one of the lucky few worthy of such lofty praise, managing to scrape by virtue of an exceptional self-buff and a Kai that gives her the sorely needed FP to make some actual use out of said skill; the second skill is an alright boost, pushing her autoguns into the realm of "kinda sorta decent" and slightly bolstering her defences, but don't be deceived by her Medium Armour and high Evasion, a tank she ain't and her abysmal luck makes sure she can't play the part for long.

>At long last, here is the "frontline BB" the playerbase has dreamed of for ages, and how closely does she match that moniker!  
Close in firing mechanics, damage output, bulk and price tag - a staggering *16 oil* - to a proper battlecruiser, Azuma is at her best in lategame engagements, where her AoE-capable guns and barrage are able to shoot over the uncomfortably common shields from a distance and smash the clusters of tightly-packed mobs as she weathers almost effortlessly the incoming hailstorm of bullets thanks to her Heavy Armour (if she's wielding the VH Plate, that is).  
That said, don't make the mistake of thinking Heavy Armour makes her invincible - while regular gunfire will now only scratch some paint off of her, torpedoes and aerial ordnance are now much more lethal threats you will have to manoeuvre out of the way of (or have tanked by someone slimmer), lest you see your precious 'frontline battleship' meet the same fate enemy Kongous usually do.

The good news is that Chikuma is incredibly survivable - at the time of writing (18/09/21) she's the toughest non-research vanguard unit in the game by a considerable margin, owing to the quite frankly obscene amount of defensive buffs she enjoys and to a much minor degree the debuffs her seaplane bombs can throw at enemies. Quite unreliable, but something nevertheless.  
The bad news? The devs are cowards and didn't make her an actual CAV, or bank harder on the seaplanes angle. Boo.

> Someone at the design bureau must've missed a memo when they designed Ibuki.  
Sporting an IJN DD's skillset and an IJN CA's statline, by all rights she should be a failure on both accounts - but against all odds, she ends up taking both's best attributes and only few of the flaws.  
Her IJN DD side shines through her double preloaded torpedo spreads, the ludicrous 185% Torpedo Efficiency and entirely Torpedo-focused skills (including, if Fated, a neat +Eva buff on torpedo launch); her IJN CA side comes to the fore during the lulls inbetween torpedo strikes, as she falls back on her remarkable Torp-CA gunnery and sturdy frame to keep up the offensive.  
That said, however, she's much more of a DD than a CA - to perform at her best she needs Oxygen Torpedoes, which limit her survivability (in comparison to other CAs at least, she's still considerably tougher than most IJN DDs), as well as suitable targets, which restricts her use cases to Sirens and bosses or alternatively particularly menacing mobs.
Still, as long as you employ her for the surgical strikes she's made for, she has little to no rivals in her field.

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/TakaoChibi.png "IJN Takao") - **[IJN Takao](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Takao)**
* Above average Gun DPS, **high Torp DPS**, medium tank.

* Skill:
  * 30% chance to do double damage when firing main gun
  * 30% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch
  * Has 31 Speed (the average CL has 32), barrages every 4 Main Gun firing cycles and gains +10% EvaRate for the rest of the battle when she does (only for the first barrage).

* Desc: 
>The archetypal Torp-CA, Takao can't decide whether to focus on guns or torpedoes and ends up doing a little bit of both.  
Being an IJN CA, this means she gets a much better torp suite than her not-IJN peers and CL-like speed to go with the solid gunnery (mostly because of her 30% chance for double fire); a good deal, if for some reason you think you need a Torp-CA and a tough hull to go along with it (courtesy of the Takao-class specific EvaRate boost upon first barrage).


![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/SuzuyaChibi.png "Suzuya") - **[IJN Suzuya](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Suzuya)** 
* Roles:
  * **Above average Gun DPS (barrage reliant)**, average torp DPS. Goes squish.

* Skill:
  * Each time Suzuya's Main Gun lands 8 hits (not consecutively, each shell counts as 1 hit), gain 1 stack of +5% Firepower and +25% Reload up to a maximum of 3 stacks; upon gaining max stacks, her barrage improves (gains two lines of 4 AP shots in a tight cone).
  * Take -20% AP damage.
  * Can take a CL gun, but shouldn't UNLESS it's the Seattle Gun.

* Desc: 
>CAs aren't known for their barrages, but Suzuya isn't going to let that get her down.   
Blessed with one of the best vanguard barrages currently available once upgraded, and bolstered by buffs that naturally improve both her ability to barrage and the barrage itself, she's uniquely positioned to take advantage of an otherwise ignored feature of this class without sacrificing actual gunnery in the process.  
And speaking of gunnery, the addition of the Seattle Gun - the only CL gun able to match CA gunnery on a relatively even footing and the only real choice for CL gunnery on boss fleets - makes Suzuya suddenly a lot more viable, capable as she is of maximising its effectiveness with her CA FP, relatively high efficiency and barraging a lot more, given the improved volume of fire.
On the flipside, said barrage is also her most noteworthy feature - manual play is almost mandatory in order to play to her strength. 

![CB](/Images-for-the-Guide/ÄgirChibi.png "seamen demon") - **[KMS Agir](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Ägir)**
* Role:
  * **Super Heavy Tank**, **extreme Gun DPS (Arcing, AoE shells; strong innate secondaries)**, **strong Slow and Armour Break debuffer**.

* Skill:
  * Upon hitting an enemy with torpedoes, lower its Speed by -60% for 5s. So long as the fleet has ammo, gain +15% Evasion.
  * If mounting an AP or Normal gun, take -15% damage and gain +12% CritRate. If mounting a HE gun, deal +12% damage but become unable to Ignite enemies. If the gun mounted is of CB calibre (ie. 283mm+), gain +12% Main Gun Efficiency.
  * If there are no enemies close to Agir, deal Armour Break to any enemy hit by her shells. Barrage every 8 main gun firing cycles, or if mounting a CB calibre main gun, every 4.
  * +15% damage vs Sirens.
  * Has MGM+1 and innate Heavy Armour, as well excellent long-range ghost secondaries.
    * The 4 GHOST SECONDARY SHOTS deal 23 bdmg with 135/95/70 amods, and have an 8% chance to Ignite targets struck. The gun has an efficency of 45%, range 75, and reloads in 2.32s.

- Desc: The seamen demon cometh.
>Agir is extremely tough, obscenely powerful, shockingly useful, and lacks anything even vaguely resembling a weakness or downside. So much for balance. Oh well.  
The toughness is upheld by her backliner-like massive HP pool and bolstered by the +15% Evasion as well as the -15% damage taken (if mounting an AP gun, which you'll usually do); the power comes from the combination of debuffs, strong aimed barrages, secondary fire and sheer strength of high calibre guns; the support is rather self-explanatory, keeping targets under semi-constant Armour Break and being able to inflict heavy slows on demand is the kind of utility others can only dream of.  
About as subtle as a sledgehammer, Agir brutalises with little effort spent most opponents and can take withering punishment for minutes on end. The extent of her complexity lies mostly in the realm of auto optimisation, as you may consider adjusting her torpedoes in order to have her launch when battleships or possibly carriers are about to strike. Triple acoustic torpedoes usually do the trick, but feel free to experiment if they don't!

* Ski
  * Deal +35% damage to DD/CL.
  * May equip the 283mm SKC28, but shouldn't unless there are shields to shoot over.

>Too large for mere CA and too small for proper BCs, these Pocket Battleships are odd creatures.  
Capable of mounting a unique underchambered BB gun, they sport massive amounts of Firepower, a wide and severely damaging barrage and a raging hatred for anyone smaller than they (DD and CL) - but are let down by that same gun's AP element (which underperforms against DD and CL), their lower-than-average Speed and Evasion, and the weak torpedoes they're stuck with.  
A wrecking ball against small craft, to be sure, but watch out for when they pick a fight with people her size.

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/Prinz_AdalbertChibi.png "Anal") - **[KMS Prinz Adalbert](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Prinz_Adalbert)**
* Roles:
  * **Vanguard protector (off-tank)**; High DPS (high Gun DPS, medium barrage DPS, medium torp DPS), heavy tank.
 
* Skill:
  * Gain +10% Accuracy. Upon Main Gun fire, 70% chance to launch a [double punch criss-cross barrage](https://streamable.com/400tan) (10s cooldown between procs).
    * BARRAGE DATA PENDING. Presumably the pellets are going to be similar in damage to Heinrich's.
  * Every 20s and above 60% HP, generate a barrier whose HP equals to 4% of Adalbert's max HP for 8s; if there are other units in the vanguard, its HP rises to 8% and takes half the damage sustained by the other vanguards for 8s. If below 60% HP, gain +15% Torp.
  * Has exceptionally good ghost secondaries! (21x4 bdmg, 2.74s base reload, 40% efficiency, 115% coeff, 100/100/100 armour modifiers, 90 range, 1 pierce).
  * Can also equip the 283mm SKC28.

- Desc:
> Prinz Adalbert is a more defensive-oriented counterpart to her sister Heinrich - sharing her bountiful statline (barring a -10% eff to the main guns, given to the torpedoes), access to the SKC28 and powerful inbuilt secondaries as well as a propensity towards fisting things with her barrage, she differs in that the 'selfish' self-boosts are replaced with a tough *vanguard-protecting* barrier and her barrage heads for the flanks rather than smash forwards.  
Unlike her sister, Adalbert's primary job is being an off-tank rather than a main tank: her shield **stops working** once she falls below 60% HP, meaning you'll want someone else tough in front while she makes that someone's (and the unit in the middle's) job easier.  
For some reason, she boosts her torps once she falls below 60% HP. It's better than nothing, but you definitely want her to stick to shielding people for as long as possible.


![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/Prinz_HeinrichChibi.png "Henry The Thick") - **[KMS Prinz Heinrich](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Prinz_Heinrich)**
* Roles:
  * Very high DPS (high Gun DPS, medium barrage DPS, medium torp DPS); very heavy main tank.
 
* Skill:
  * If sortied with 1+ other KMS unit, gain +15% Eva and Reload; upon Main Gun fire, 50% chance to deal +25% Main Gun damage for 5s (has a 7s cooldown).
  * Every 20s, fire a... boat-shaped barrage? and deploy either a 2-torp shield or a 10-shots shield for 10s, randomly picked.
    * The 52 BALLS (traveling in 2 blocks of 26 each) deal 22 bdmg with 100/100/100 mods. They are modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * Has exceptionally good ghost secondaries! (21x4 bdmg, 2.74s base reload, 40% efficiency, 115% coeff, 100/100/100 armour modifiers, 90 range, 1 pierce).
  * Can also equip the 283mm SKC28.

- Desc:
> Prinz Heinrich is what Deutschland and Spee would've looked like had they been designed properly, and represents a massive improvement over either in every possible respect; superb staying power, extremely competitive damage output that allows her to not only match but also outgun proper Gun-CA without banking excessively on her (comparatively decent) torpedoes, and access to the same SKC28 of old, for which her 7s cooldown damage boost appears to be designed (but don't stress too much about it, even if you go for faster guns with more appropriate modifiers you'll be gaining more than you lose overall).  
Something to bear in mind is that, more than most Torp-CA, she is capable of handling shields; while torpedoes do slip past them, the SKC28 can shoot over them and her 20s barrage has a very high shot count, capable of punching straight through most of them (assuming the barrage lands, at least, which isn't unlikely given its tight and clustered pattern).

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/Roon_µChibi.png "Moon") - **[Muse Roon](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Roon_µ)**
* Roles:
  * **Roon but legitimately good. Above average Gun DPS (barrage reliant), enemy speed/defence debuffer**; medium shielded tank. Manual play strongly recommended.
 
* Skill:
  * Every 15s, fire a [barrage](https://streamable.com/bfiee0) that increases the damage taken by targets hit by +10% for 6s; if only 1 target is hit by it, stop it for 3s and launch a brief linear torpedo burst.
    * The 6 MUSICAL NOTES deal 30 bdmg with 120/120/120 amods; the 6 AIMED TORPEDOES deal 62 bdmg with 120/120/120 amods. 
  * Upon battle start and every 30s afterwards, generates 2 blue orbiting shields (lasting 8 shots or 15s) and 3 red orbiting shields (dealing damage on contact up to 8 times).
  * Has MGM+1 and torpedoes. Really, *really* bad torpedoes.

- Desc: Super strong meme boat? Awful PR? Why not both?
>As Roon done right, Moon ditches most of what drags the original down (horrible ammo-swap in primis) in favour of a surprisingly strong set of supportive/offensive abilities; more barrages are free damage, and in this case they bring some very significant debuffs with them, while shields that would have accomplished little beyond getting immediately shot up now stay around to wreck enemy units.  
As hilariously superior as Moon is, one thing has not changed, namely the reliance on manual play: the red shields don't orbit far and the new barrages are still linear, so she'll risk wasting significant chunks of DPS if auto is at the helm (especially when it comes to aforementioned barrages).

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/Saint_LouisChibi.png "Saint Louis") - **[FFNF Saint Louis](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Saint_Louis)**
* Roles:
  * **Extreme Gun DPS (HE-locked)**, average Torp DPS, light tank.

* Skill:
  * +35% HE damage and -3% Ignition chance
  * Upon battle start, gain +8 Speed (permanent) and +30% Evasion (for 50s)
  * Deal +15% damage to Sirens.
  * Has MGM+1 and torpedoes.

- Desc: DESU VULT!
> Historically praised by multiple navies as one of the absolute best heavy cruiser designs but robbed of its chance to shine due to the fall of France in WW2, Azur Lane's Saint Louis has come to set the record straight - and does she ever.  
Mightiest of all CA by weight of stats and skills, there is no area where she doesn't excel - her guns absolutely melt opposing Light Armour and punch through Heavy Armour better than most other frontliners' in the game, her Speed is slightly superior to that of CLs and enjoys a hefty boost to her already high Evasion for more than half a minute after the battle starts, her AA is uncharacteristically high for her class and she enjoys all the perks of her Spe-CA peers (Medium Armour, MGM+1 and Torpedoes).  
The only fault one can find in her would be her barrage - its wide linear pattern helps dispatching multiple weak foes, yes, but also neuters its impact against single targets.

![CL](/Images-for-the-Guide/AlgérieChibi.png "The first e is accented") - **[MNF Algerie](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Algérie)**
* Role:
  * **High Gun DPS, average Torp DPS** (w/ extra damage vs DD/BB), **heavy tank** (w/ extra torpedo defence).

* Skill:
  * Deal +15% damage to Ignited enemies. 20s after battle start, launch an Igniting [barrage](https://streamable.com/i5zks9); this barrage is also launched on a 70% chance on Main Gun fire, with a 10s internal cooldown.
    * The 18 HE CA shots deal 20 bdmg with 135/95/70 armour modifiers. They are modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * Upon battle start, gain a frontal torpedo shield; the shield lasts 20s and is respawned every 30s. The shield can block up to 5 torpedo hits; while the shield is active, Algérie gains +15% FP and deals +12% damage to DD/BB. Also, if auto mode has been off for more than 5s, gain +8 Speed and +15% Evasion.
 
- Desc: Torp-CA done right.
>Torp-CA have a very poor reputation in Azur Lane, one that's mostly deserved at that - with the stats to gun hard but without the weight of fire required, without the stats to torpedo hard but with the mounts for it, they're in almost all cases the worst kind of hybrid, the bad-of-all-trades, master of none.  
Algérie rectifies this unfortunate situation by, amusingly, leaning more into the gun side of her kit - her shelling, aided by the barrage, is strong enough to be somewhat competitive with dedicated Gun-CAs, while her torpedoes are well-capable of taking out hard targets (BB in primis).  
Her staying power is also impressive, in part because of the excellent statline, in part because of the +Evasion, and in part because of the anti-torpedo shield (which counterintuitively you want to *keep safe*, as it increases her damage output).

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/PolaChibi.png "Not Essex") - **[RN Pola](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Pola)**
* Roles:
  * **Zara buffer, heavy tank**; Regia Marina vanguard buffer, high Gun DPS (better vs Medium Armour).

* Skill:
  * Upon Main Gun fire, 50% chance to fire a SAP barrage (10s internal cooldown); if sortied with 2+ Regia Marina units, Pola included, increase the firing chance to 70%.
     * The 16 SAP SHOTS deal 20 bdmg with 65/125/65 amods. They are modified by 100% of the unit's FP-
  * Gain +15% Evasion for the first 45s of the battle; also, grant +10% FP and +15% AA to all vanguard RM units, and -6% damage taken to all Zara-class units.

- Desc: Ardisco ad ogni impresa~
>The long-awaited Zara-class sister ship, Pola is every bit as tough and strong as Zara and then some.  
Owing to her slightly increased weapon efficiencies, a powerful linear SAP barrage and a valuable set of buffs (AA aside as no Regia Marina vanguard presently can even pretend to shoot up properly), Pola serves as the sword to Zara's shield(s).  
That is not to say she is frail, of course: she sports Zara's high eHP and bolsters it further with the 45s Eva boost as well as the damage reduction, but as Zara's shielding hinges on her taking hits, it is clear whose job it is to tank and whose to off-tank.

  * After 10s from battle start (at a 100% chance) and every 20s afterwards (at a 40% chance), launch a flare at the closest enemy. Enemies within the flare lose -25% Evasion Rate and lasts 10s.

>When the news dropped there'd be a new Trento-class and that she'd be purple, what little hope there was evaporated. As it happens, that judgement may have been slightly premature.  
Granted, her statline has improved little over poor Trento and retains the depressing Light Armour, but her kit seems to acknowledge that by giving her a useful defence buff for herself and whoever will lead - and more importantly, or perhaps surprisingly, *the best CA barrage in the entire game*.  
Keep her safely sandwiched between tougher units and let her wreak havoc undisturbed.

>Hands down the best vanguard tank in the game, when just more Evasion won't cut it.  
Portland Kai may be cheap, Prinz Eugen may have more eHP and Moon may have more DPS,  but none of them have her spectacular shields nor her combination of good DPS and high eHP at the same time, and that's what pushes her above her competitors.    
While the damage boosts are undoubtedly good and allow her to perform optimally under every circumstance, the shields are the real stars of the show here - not only their uptime is much higher than the 18% would lead you to believe, able as they are to proc on *any* attack that collides with her chibi (even if she evades the damage), the front-facing shield is absolutely invaluable when it comes to blocking incoming enemy fire entirely, especially if it's piercing enemy fire.  
If you're sick of seeing your poor vanguard get turned inside out, Zara is the solution to your problems.

>BURY THEM UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF LEAD. Or icicles. Or both, actually.  
See the link above? There's your description. No, really: Kronk's main thing is dumping an ungodly amount of shells downrange, rivaled only by a select few vanguards like Kyiv or Le Terrible (all of them lacking her CB statline or arcing fire capabilities), thanks to her dual CL secondaries and dual barrages.  
Where's the catch? Mostly in her comparative lack of support, although Agir is a total standout in that regard and Kronk compensates by having a minor-but-still-useful self-heal should it prove necessary, and the barrage patterns being somewhat wide (although still focus-able to some degree).

In any case, Tallinn is exceptionally bulky, *even* by the lofty standards of tank CAs, courtesy of her double layer of shields; hitshield first, then hpshield second, and a nice aimed barrage in-between for some extra firepower as the hitshield inevitably breaks. Just as well, since despite her above average damage output, a Torp-CA's a Torp-CA (with poor torpedoes to boot) and volume of fire will be sorely lacking no matter what.

Kasumi isn't a particularly imaginative unit; very tough owing to her meaty statline, respectably armed with IJN-grade CA torps and solid guns (for a Torp-CA), she performs much like a Portland with less of a concern for shields and some more for auto play, even if the aimed barrage kind of alleviates it.

A strong statline allows her to capitalise well on said buffs, although the +Acc is by most indications the useless roll and the heal loses value if she is not damaged (and if she is, it does not compete with real heals).  
At any rate, tough and dependable in spite of the RNG buffs - and RNG willing, she will be very good.

Her direct competitor would be Portland Kai, and while she comes out of that comparison looking pretty weak (lower eHP, the extra FP comes at the expense of higher Oil costs, the lack of a barrage and the need to take at least 2+ Kizunas to outgun her), she is nonetheless a tough nut to crack and she can pack a good punch.

Her DPS starts out low but - given enough time and luck - grows to respectable levels and is further helped by the Armour Break; speaking of which, the slash she fires has low damage too but it is well capable of piercing enemies from one end of the screen to the other, which is nice (and concerning if you let so many enemies pile up).

    * The 9 SHELLS deal 170 bdmg with 50/120/115 mods; the 30 DD PELLETS deal 20 bdmg with 120/60/60 mods (and have 50 Range). The damage of both is modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * Gain a persistent stack of +2.5% FP per enemy node destroyed, and gain a temporary stack +2.5% FP per enemy destroyed in battle (up to a cap of 17.5%, meaning that Alabama starts with more stacks the more nodes she fights but still can't go past +17.5%); also, after the 5th destroyed node, the backline takes -8% damage.

- Desc: Washington 2: The Blackening.
>Meant to take centre place in mob fleets, owing to her strong set of self-buffs that ramp over the course of multiple engagements and a minor but nice backline protection past the fifth fight, Alabama is both strong and reliable.
While she can work on boss fleets, so long as she gets some kills before it spawns and nobody else wants the flag slot, she's better off playing to her strengths.  
Also, a W13 tip - her barrage is AP, focused and linear. This means it can be expected to take on those pesky Command Craft and blow them up reliably, all you have to do is place her in the top position.

>Georgia is a simple woman - she sees a big gun, she barrages.  
There's really not much to say about her. Very straightforward USS BB, sporting the characteristically excellent AA of her peers, albeit improved, and their same DD guns; her most remarkable feature the fact her barrage is both absolute murder *and* partially aimed, meaning it can be used from the sidelines with just a minor loss in performance, as well as her lacking one Main Gun Mount (which is partially made up for by the high Main Gun Efficiency, and partially by the devastating barrage).  
That said, while the SHS shots are the ones that'll be most relevant to you, the DD HE shower is no joke and shouldn't be discounted, especially when you need to bring all the guns to bear and/or the boss has Light Armour; bear in mind that zippier bosses may need some slowing down for the SHS to connect.

* Skill: 
  * Gain +8% FP/AA/Evasion for every USB BB/CA in the fleet, up to +24%.
  * Main Gun damage increases by up to +15% the farther the target is; if mounting USN DD secondaries, Main Gun ammo is overrideen to SHS (65/135/115, shells fire at extremely high angles and fall from the sky) and the distance damage bonus increases to +30%. **Do not give her USN DD secondaries**.

* Desc: Massachusetts shoots for the stars, but the aim isn't quite there. 
>Once synonymous with 'atrocious aim', Massachussetts' enforced SHS ammo and its much reduced AoE (8 as opposed to the BB shell standard 15) rendered all but incapable of hitting anything moving faster than a rock, which squandered her otherwise remarkable statline and buffs.   
Well, no more of that now; so long as you do NOT give her a USS BB secondary (why would you anyway, 128SKC are better at interception), Massa still gets to enjoy a fairly meaty distance damage boost without torpedoeing her physical hit rate in the process.  
A very solid pick for USS fleets, all in all.

>A godsend for the lacklustre USS backline roster, New Jersey sets out to hardcarry the entire faction out of infamy and into the big leagues - and almost succeeds beautifully in that task.  
Not so much because the buffs she provides are especially notable, though they definitely are (especially for carriers, which she can help across fleets), or because she herself is horrifyingly powerful (she is THE strongest BB in the game, at the time of writing, and sporting a devastating debuffing displaced half-preloaded autocritting AND aimed barrage ON TOP of a statline only the notoriously expensive and hard to raise FdG can hope to match), but because of the versatility of her design and the smashing performaces she puts out on all counts.  
Is it finally time to run full USS fleets, then? Well, no, not really; she's devastating and she does God's work for her fellows, but alas, the rest of the roster does reman lacklustre (especially when it comes to CV, BB and DD) compared to other nations. Still, her conditions are easily satisfied, and setting her up with Helena for boss fleets is almost a no-brainer.

Normally this would call for a removal from the list, but she does remain a competent BB with a neat gimmick that very few units have so far tried to emulate (just Ingraham, really); if you fear planes a lot and don't mind the somewhat meh damage output, you may consider taking her along, and when backed by San Diego / San Juan, she'll be all but immune to planes.  
That said, do remember that high AA without the backing of high AA Efficiency means she can only *tank* planes, not kill them.

A bit fiddly, but arguably more flexible than most and just as powerful.

A slow ramp, sure, but better than nothing.  
Her double damage proc needs RNG to work, but when it does it'll let her deal significant damage.

Bear in mind that despite her having a barrage, she isn't *really* a BBarrager - what she has is little bit of extra utility, intended for BBs to make sure they land shots on the zippiest enemies, and a smattering of free damage every 20s. Emphasis on smattering.

The self-FP buffs are granted via easily achieved conditions, considering both Duke of York and Monarch are mainstays in most boss fleets anyway; worse comes to worst, there's no shortage of HMS units favouring having more HMS units around.

>It'd be easy to regard Monarch as a straight upgrade to Hood - and for the most part, she kind of is.
She mounts CL guns (for a greater FP boost and better anti-fireship prowess), her FP and Efficiencies are much better, her barrage is AP (great for handling lategame priority targets and bosses) and she can even heal herself, extending her operational time well beyond that of her 'predecessor' while gaining Reload for every % of missing HP... what more could one possibly want from a battleship?  
Not a whole lot, all in all, but one would best remember that both AA and Armour Modifiers are something to take into account: while Monarch will indeed mop the floor with light and hard targets alike, Hood does still possess a superior rate of fire married to a Reload-boosting powerful barrage, both helpful things to have during mob fleet engagements (as well as the Normal BB ammo mods) where sheer, brutal damage output may bot be the best course of action at any time.  
In short, have Monarch handle Medium/Heavy bosses while Hood (or someone else) handles the mobs; you'll be glad you did, when her AP deluge, 145% Efficiency main guns and mounting Reload all spell doom to your unfortunate opponent.

>Well, the Kai's come and gone, and Warspite's left in a slightly better position than she originally was - as far as PvE is concerned, at least.  
While her statline did enjoy a substantial offensive boost in the form of more stats, chief among which her absurd 100 Accuracy (roughly a fourth more than of most BBs), higher Efficiencies and a strong passive skill, her new-and-improved barrage suffers from the same unreliability that torpedoed her shot(s) at glory - as powerful as those AP shells now are, they're still all too likely to be fired at Light targets (or worse, at fireboats), while the marker part of barrage appears to be bafflingly ineffectual, as evidenced both by *HMS BB/C still opening fire on unmarked targets* and by the possibility of *multiple markers coexisting, negating the supposed benefits*.  
On the bright side, Warspite's newfound strength lets her be competitive there once more in the PvP areans, where her intended targets are always armoured, immobile and valuable.

>Heh, typical nobles. Profiting from their underlings and giving next to nothing in return.  
While KGV is yet another sovereign that doesn't buff back her fellow countrywomen, there's no denying the buff she receives from them is both quite simple to attain (the HMS is spoiled for good backline choices) and substantial; not only that, her damage buff is hardly ever out of a job considering 99% of the enemies in PvE are IJN.  
As for the 356mm, long story short - it only overtakes the good ol' 406MK6 if her first volley lands most of its shots and hits something valuable, otherwise the long cooldown and the subpar damage eventually catch up to her; it won't cripple her but she won't benefit a whole lot from it either, and her barrage is fairly anaemic anyway so buffing it isn't too desirable a prospect.  
In short, she's a big burly beatstick that'll benefit from having some HMS cheerleaders around. Only let her be the flag if nobody else has a better barrage.

She remains a very simple unit overall, almost-preload aside (which can become a full preload if you give her a HPFCR, French-style); stick her in with USS units, preferably cruisers and carriers (feel free to use BBs instead though) and let her work her magic, buffing herself and her colonial buddies all the while.

>Vanguard is not a vanguard, despite her moniker, but she can help vanguards as long as Vanguard stays alive. Got it? Good.  
You may consider Vanguard a more modern Duke of York - relatively light on the damage and making up for it in spades through her support - that received some sorely-needed upgunning and a barrage worthy of the name, exceptionally strong secondaries owing to the guaranteed crits and the strongest AA suite you'll find on a backliner in the whole game. It's not just good - it's enough to compete with dedicated AA vanguards!  
Of course, the crown jewel of the arrangement remain the de/buffs. Vanguard does not slow anymore, preferring instead to debuff enemies that dare exist in her presence for more than 2s and boosting her fellow big guns' damage output when her guns reload (thus ensuring the buff always fires off in time, including her own barrage) - not that firing off first is a major concern for her, courtesy of the hefty +20% Reload on a considerable stat base.  
The one weaknesses she would have, would be her relative weakness (relative to her rainbow BB peers, that is) - so long as she is sortied solo, she'll fall behind them (as well as the strongest gold big guns, like Vittorio Veneto or Seydlitz), but of course, she's at her best when she's NOT going it solo.  
She's a force multiplier first and foremost, remember!

If it weren't for the gimmick attached to her powerful main barrage, Tosa would be yet another competent but unremarkable BBarrager, hampered by a near-total lack of supportive capabilities; however, through the wonders of IJN magicks, that barrage holds the unique ability to fire from the flagship slot regardless of whether she's actually in there or not, a massive boon for every BBarrager as that's where barrages deal the most damage.  
While Tosa has two more barrages, as mentioned, only the main one is worth much credit. The proximity barrage, while alright and decent enough at putting some fire downrange, needs her to be the flagship to make the most of it (which goes against her role as off-flag BBarrager) and the support barrage is so pitifully weak and limited it's simply better to pretend it doesn't exist at all.

All in all she's usable, but she's so far behind the real self-healers (Gascogne, Monarch) and real barragers (most of the higher tiers) there's honestly not much point to her.

* Desc (2021): KMS QE.
>Being compared to Queen Elizabeth is typically not a good sign, as it is less praise of its faction buffing qualities (albeit deserved) and more an indictment of its severely lacking battlefield prowess (also deserved); Bismarck is, then, particularly unfortunate in that her former qualities are rather limited and are not offset by her performance as a battleship. As it stands, the only buffs worth consideration are those directed at KMS CVs - an extra 20% damage is hefty - as the other buffs are concerningly meagre, Tirpitz enabling aside. +12% Reload is barely noticeable, and +20% CritRate is more impressive on paper than it is in practice.  
As for her own merits, there are little of note. The guaranteed crit on the first salvo of every volley is welcome, but the CL secondaries' range extension is poorly thought out and is much more likely to leave her defenceless rather than anything else. 90 range is the distance from your end of the screen and the white line, meaning she can't actually assist the vanguard, and at such a long range the travel time incurred by the secondaries would make her unable to hit the incoming fireships - also, if they DO hit, there's no guarantee they'll take down the target, considering the reduced damage they inflict (especially once the ammo is all spent).
Last and least, she has a barrage too. It has the unique distinction of being so bad it's not worth even taking into consideration when picking gear.
In short... she's a very hard sell. Even as a CV buffer you'd be better off using a third KMS CV, if you happen to have them.

What, you want more? Fine. Fred the Fat is unreasonably strong, fully deserving of her status as a DR (and the disgusting ***19*** Oil cost) brimming as she is in the sheer staying power granted by her escalating defence buff and nearly 10k base HP as well as firepower, courtesy of the devastating 160% Main Gun Efficiency she gets without sacrificing gun mounts or an easily-procced, powerful defensive barrage.  
If one were to look hard for any chinks in her Plot Armour it could be said that her HitRate is abysmal, not that BBs exactly shine in that regard; nevertheless she's uncharacteristically bad in that regard, suffering from the PR standard 0 Luck and a meagre 65 Accuracy, but it's an easily solved issue anyway.

>Ancient WWI vintage puts to shame terminally ill fox. Love it!
Amagi may not be the first unit that comes to mind for a comparison, but the similarities become more evident the more you look at her: the barrage pattern is quite close (despite the lower damage), the ability to slap debuffs on enemies is also there (albeit somewhat reduced), so is the ability to accelerate the first volley (and is strong enough to basically preload, provided you accompany her with Seydlitz).  
The PvP design in her is more evident than it is in Seyds, and the biggest clue is the fixed 3.000 damage: by PvE standards it's basically nothing, but in PvP that may very well be half of a DD's HP pool! Still, with a 10% chance, it's best not to rely on it.
