# Your Waifu is SHIP's opinionated & extra-biased JP Tier Guide (CROSSWAIT EDITION)

## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
Azur Lane is a special little gem of a game. In a mobile market saturated by predatory, thinly disguised gambling simulators posing as RPGs, where the only valid choice is the rarest, most expensive, most lootboxable one, Azur Lane bucks the trend by having ALL of its units entirely viable for all content, given proper gear and care.

Indeed, you could even interpret the tiers as a relative measure of how much investment is needed to get these units to perform, if you wish - a T0 would be a beast almost right out of the gate, whereas an untiered unit would require disproporFtionate amounts of effort - but I'd recommend treating the tiers as they're meant to be, according to the criteria below.

Whatever the case and however you choose to read this guide, I want to stress this - ALL units are viable, SOME are better than others, NONE of them will work if you don't know how to use them.
Good reading, and godspeed cap'n!
## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
 
  
  
### Evaluation Criteria:
- Ships are tiered by their PvE PERFORMANCE first and foremost, but notes on notable PvP usage will be made if suitable.
- Ships are tiered according to their ability to act as a STAND-ALONE unit.
- Ships unable to fulfil the above criterion (eg. carriers as a whole, Vestal) are rated according to their ability to act as a SUPPORT unit; buffs/debuffs/aa/heals garner higher ranks than sheer damage output, especially during boss fights. See assorted notes for reasoning.
- Ships are compared to others in their OWN CLASS for tiering purposes; if two ships are have comparable stats and purpose, the least expensive one will be ranked higher.
- Ships in a tier are listed alphabetically and in order of nationality (USS -> HMS -> IJN -> KMS).
- All units are assumed to be MAXED (ie. lv120, BiS gear, SL10 across the board).
- Auto or Manual performance is not taken into consideration, unless it is specifically relevant to the unit.
- The Retrofit Priority List orderings are decided on the basis of how effective is the retrofitted unit, not how much does it need the retrofit; in other words, the better (more powerful/more useful) the retrofit, the higher it is.
  
  
  
#### Tier Explanations:
- Tier 0                : The best of the best, rivaled by few and matched by none. They set the bar for everyone else.
- Tier 0.5              : Terrifyingly effective units with little to no real competition in their class or function, usually by virtue of exceptionally strong skills and statlines.
- Tier 1                : Generally very effective units, albeit marred by some minor flaw that can be easily overlooked or fixed.
- Tier 1.5              : Niche, quirky or plain but solid, these units can perform their roles well but will need to be handled with care.
- Tier 2                : Very niche and/or flawed but still noteworthy, these units can nevertheless do you good but will require serious work to get them to.
- Not Tiered            : Ships that range from 'usable' to 'bottom of the barrel', but in both cases not good enough to make it on the list.
- Pro Team Players      : Ships that, while unremarkable on their own, become exceedingly good when deployed with each other. They are tiered as a single unit.
- Honourable Mentions   : Ships that, while too weak or unwieldy for general usage, nonetheless possess some interesting or useful quirk that may warrant attention.
  
  
  
#### Retrofit/Kai Priority List:
- DD                  : Laffey > Ayanami = Z23 > Z1 > Cassin/Downes > Kagerou = Tanikaze > Nicholas > Javelin > Foxhound = Shiranui
- CL                  : San Diego* > Jintsuu > Leander > Leipzig > Ping Hai/Ning Hai > Emile Bertin > Abukuma > Curlew/Curacoa > Ajax/Achilles
- CA                  : London > Portland > Mogami > Furutaka/Kako > Suffolk
- BB/C                : Hyuuga > Ise > Yamashiro/Fusou (DO NOT TAKE LAST TWO NODES) > F* > Nevada/Oklahoma
- CV/L                : Shouhou > Hiryu/Soryu > Ranger = Saratoga > Langley
  
  
  
#### Assorted notes:
- Read the VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE at the top.
- The 'loadout' listed under CV/L entries details the number of planes each unit gets; eg. Unicorn gets 3 Fighters / 0 Dive Bombers / 3 Torpedo Bombers.
- The asterisk next to a name in the Priority List means the Kai is tied to some sort of event and may not be available right now; also, if you do not see a name in it, it's because it is not worth prioritizing.
- If you're wondering why carriers are judged differently from the rest, consider the following - they have no self-defence capabilities against suicide boats and are inherently worse than big guns at handling hard targets due to ordnance scatter and unhelpful anti-Heavy modifiers, but their AoE damage dispatches waves better than big guns usually do and come stock with screen clears.
tldr; BB/BC and CV/CVL do different things, holding them to the same standards makes little sense.

  
  
#### Credits:
- This guide is far from a solo effort: while the writing is mine, the tierings are researched and approved collegially with Gurosebe#4054, Enbayft#2527, Cantarella#7963 and the #helpful fellows over at the Azur Lane English Community server, while the coding framework that makes this possible was provided by Enbayft#2527 and improved upon by Boz#5174; the gifs have been provided by Halfminute#6110 and the CN wiki; lastly, kudos to Kopfj√§ger for providing the original framework for the guide you're now reading.  
Without these people, the Tier Guide would never be as comprehensive, accurate or good-looking as it is, and it is to them that I extend my sincere gratitude.
Oh, and one last thing...
 
#### Want to buy me a coffee?
- Curating, maintaining and researching for this Guide is something I've been doing for over a year now, ever since a few months after the first CN servers were opened to the public. It's a time-consuming endeavour, to be sure, but one I gladly do.  
If you find what I do here and/or on the Discords #helpful and would like to show me your gratitude in a slightly more tangible way, feel free to click here and buy me a coffee - thanks! (https://ko-fi.com/J3J6WRI2)

### Tier 0:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b8/LaffeyKaiChibi.png "Laffey Kai") - **[USS Laffey Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Laffey#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% activation upon firing, increases own FP, Reload, and Evasion by 40% for 8s.
  * Every 20 seconds, has a 70% chance to active Vanquish Mode, increasing own Reload stat by 200% for 10 seconds and releasing a powerful barrage.
  
* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Manual Only (ie. as you should use her)] 138.6mm; 610mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 127mm twin; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox

- Desc: Vorpal Bunny.
>While pretty good to begin with, once Kai'd Laffey truly stands out thanks to CL-tier Firepower and Efficiency coupled with absurd amounts of Reload, allowing her to akimbo gun down any fool standing in her way. Her torpedoes also come out much quicker than anyone else's, but given the lacking nature of US torps spamming them is one of the few ways to keep them relevant.  
The DPS monster to AyaKai's DPH.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/1/1c/KitakazeChibi.png "Kitakaze") - **[IJN Kitakaze](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kitakaze)**
* Skill:
  * Main Gun modifiers are fixed to 115/115/115; also, gain +15% Main Gun Efficiency if using an IJN DD gun.
  * If sortied as Vanguard Lead, launch a torpedo barrage 10s after the start of the battle; also, upon hitting with 10 NON-BARRAGE torpedoes, launch the same torpedo barrage.
  * Has MGM+1.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 100mm twin; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 100mm twin; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: 
>Always liked the Akizuki-class's DDakka and disliked their lack of anything resembling proper firepower?  
Well, look no further, for Kitakaze dispenses with the flimsy pretense of being an AA DD like the others and goes all-in on surface weaponry - from the supercharged twinned DD gun rocking high FP and Eff with fixed 115% modifiers across the board to the solid regular/barrage torpedo suite, Kitakaze is more than capable of taking on any sort of foe and coming out on top handily (helped also by her exceptionally high HP).  
Fits any comp, is downright murderous against Heavy. Brilliant.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b4/YukikazeChibi.png "Yukikaze") - **[IJN Yukikaze](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yukikaze)**
* Skill:
  * While alive in fleet, the backline takes -8% dmg and, once per battle, heals any backliner under 20% HP for 10% of the healed unit's max HP.
  * 25% chance to activate when taking damage, decreases said damage to 1. 
  * Her regular barrage includes 4 conventional torpedoes.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 120mm Main Gun single; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm Main Gun single or 76mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: She protecc, she attacc, but most importantly, she tsun catt.
>Nowhere as devastating as her tier companions (or a good few other IJN DDs for that matter), she is nonetheless quite powerful and has incredible defensive skills for both herself and the backline.  
Also, her barrage gets a few torps thrown into it for good measure.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/47/Z23KaiChibi.png "Z23 Kai") - **[KMS Z23 Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z23#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Firepower by 60% for 8s
  * Every 20 seconds, has a 40% (70%) chance to active Destruction Mode, releasing a powerful barrage and spawning 2 rotating shields that can block 5 enemy shells each, and for 10 seconds own main gun critical rate becomes 100%.
  * Can equip CL guns, but shouldn't.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 100mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: Gun Fuhrer.
>Z23 takes the opposite approach to Ayanami, in that she goes all in on guns - her base FP is unmatched among DDs and her skills further ehnance her gun DPS to obscene degrees, while also having great uptime.  
Torps are even more of an afterthought than they are on Laffey, however, and unlike Laffey she can't make up for it by simply spamming them; she will punch ship-sized holes in Light and Medium Armour, but she'll find herself a little stumped against Heavy.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/2b/Z46Chibi.png "Z46") - **[KMS Z46](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z46)**
* Skill:
  * Whenever enemy planes are shot down within own AA range, increase FP by 15% of own total AA stat (Only base stat and gear is counted) and if skill procs again during its duration, it refreshes the buff
  * Increases AP damage by 25%
  
* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Full AA] 100mm twin; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 113mm dual AA; Research AA Radar; Research AA Radar
  * [General Purpose] 100mm twin; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 113mm dual AA; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 100mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 113mm dual AA; Toolbox; AA Radar
  
* Desc: KMSan Diego.
>The last word in terms of DD AA and well capable of going toe-to-toe with most CL on their own field of expertise, while being vastly superior in terms of damage output, survivability, ASW prowess and - most importantly - barrage quality.  
Proud owner of a quick-firing, high-volume, AP conal barrage with four homing torpedoes to the side that is boosted both by her own +APdmg skill (do not take AP DD guns unless you hate her) and her high torp stat, she puts every other standard DD barrage in the game to shame and is the main reason for her astounding effectiveness; the AA proficiency is a nice cherry on top, but not her main draw.

### Tier 0.5:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/8b/AyanamiKaiChibi.png "Ayanami Kai") - **[IJN Ayanami Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ayanami#Retrofit)** **(T0 vs Bosses)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Torpedo by 60% for 8s
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost Evasion stat by 30% for 5s

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Manual Only (ie. as you should use her)] 120mm Main Gun single; 610mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [General Purpose] 120mm Main Gun single; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm Main Gun single or 76mm; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: Nuclear Launch Detected.
>Ayanami is the last word in Torp Damage - with her skill procced, the damage she can inflict with them is completely unrivaled and, with enough buff stacking, can even reach the tens of thousands.  
On the flip side, Torpedoes are all she's got and once she's blown her load, she won't have much to do except waiting for them to come back online; and given how massively overkill her torpedoes tend to be, it would be advisable to deploy her in boss fights first, foremost and only.  
The DPH monster to LafKai's DPS.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/84/KagerouKaiChibi.png "Kagerou Kai") - **[IJN Kagerou Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kagerou#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * Grant +15% Torpedo to the entire vanguard.
  * Upon launching a torpedo spread, 30% chance to launch a second one.
  * Every 20s, 30% chance to lower an enemy's Reload by -30% and Damage by -15% for 10s (targets humanoid ships first).

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Manual Only (ie. as you should use her)] 120mm Main Gun single; 610mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [General Purpose] 120mm twin; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: 
>Widely available early on and blessed with both excellent skills and a very solid statline, Kagerou has a place in every torp-heavy frontline (torp-CA in particular, as they typically do not have access to torpedo buffs). Her Kai is more of a slight upgrade than a massive change, with her skill being middling at best, but the extra stats are appreciated nonetheless.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/49/KawakazeChibi.png "Kawakaze") - **[IJN Kawakaze](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kawakaze)**
* Skill:
  * All IJN DD deal +15% damage to CL/CA.
  * Her torpedoes always deal 115% damage against all targets, regardless of the normal torpedo modifiers (80/100/130)

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 120mm Main Gun single; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm Main Gun single or 76mm; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: Black Not Shooter.
>A veritable turncoat of a DD, Kawakaze's main purpose is making Light Armoured units' lives hell by drilling right through it with her torps and her stellar torpedo-armed barrage - and she accomplishes it beautifully.  
Terrifyingly effective against her intended targets, to the point of overtaking even Ayanami Kai - but she does still lose to her when faced with Heavy Armour, against which her skill puts her at a disadvantage.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c3/YuudachiChibi.png "Yuudachi") - **[Poi (IJN Yuudachi)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yuudachi)**
* Skill:
  * 6% chance on Main Gun fire for +40% FP/Torp/Evasion/Reload to self.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Manual Only (ie. as you should use her)] 120mm Main Gun single; 610mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [General Purpose] 120mm Main Gun single; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm Main Gun single or 76mm; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: 
>Outclassed by 3/4 Starter Kai, but still very valid. Her superior statline, her Laffey-like generalist buff that pretty much boosts EVERYTHING worth boosting on a DD and an excellent barrage let her crank out a lot of DPS even when her torps are offline.  
The general strat is to gear her with a super-fast DD gun to proc her skill+barrage as often as possible.


### Tier 1:

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/fd/CassinKaiChibi.png "Cassin Kai") ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/28/DownesKaiChibi.png "Downes Kai")- **[USS Cassin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Cassin#Retrofit)** **[USS Downes Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Downes#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * When HP falls under 20%, heals 25% of max HP once per battle
  * 60% chance to activate every 20 seconds, increase own Reload by 40% for 10 seconds

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox

- Desc: The bubblewrap fights back!
>Packing a lot of Firepower for destroyers and blessed with a decent Reload buff to go along the excellent self-heal, Cassin and Downes may not have the monstrous damage output of their IJN counterparts but they can and will outlast them many times over.  
As it is for Phoenix, they are best used in mobbing fleets.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/3c/NicholasKaiChibi.png "Nicholas Kai") - **[USS Nicholas Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nicholas#Retrofit)** **(T0.5 w/ Fletcher)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance upon firing to +40% her own Evasion and -40% damage received from planes for 8s
  * 60% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower for 8s
  * 70% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower/Torpedo/Reload for 10s and, once per battle, if an escort ship's Health falls below 20%, decrease the damage it takes by 15%. If the ship is Helena, additionally heal 8% of Helena's max Health

* Recommended Loadouts:

  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox

- Desc:
>Nicholas is a rarity among destroyers, in that she boasts both enough Firepower to face off with the best in her class and very solid defensive capabilities; a true generalist, even more so than Laffey considering her actually good torpedoes.  
With no real weakness on display, beyond simply not being quite as good as more specialised units, Nicholas is a worthy addition in pretty much any escort fleet - especially one with Helena or Fletcher.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/fe/ShigureKaiChibi.png "Shigure Kai") - **[IJN Shigure Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shigure#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * Upon Main Gun fire, 5% chance to gain +60% Evasion for 8s.
  * If deployed with Yukikaze, gain +15% Torpedo and a 70% chance every 20s to launch a special barrage; if NOT deployed with Yukikaze, grant a -5% fleetwide damage reduction and, once per battle when any unit falls below 20% HP, restore 10% of that unit's max HP.  

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Manual Only (ie. as you should use her)] 120mm Main Gun single; 610mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Oxytorp; Oxytorp
  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

- Desc: Javelin has been obsoleted. Again.  
>Poor starter just can't catch a break - first Yukikaze big dicks everyone else in her class (and beyond) in terms of sheer eHP while bringing good DPS and remarkable support, then Shigure joins in by either providing a higher-damage off-tank solution or by acting as a Yukikaze-lite if she's on her own.  
That aside, she behaves in the usual IJN DD fashion - no torps means no DPS, so make the spreads count.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/63/ShiranuiKaiChibi.png "Shiranui Kai") - **[IJN Shiranui Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shiranui#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 30% chance upon torpedo launch to launch a second spread
  * When alive in fleet, allied CV/L take -15% damage

* Recommended Loadouts:

  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

- Desc:
>Ah, the wonders of Kai. Shiranui goes from an excellent 0LB DD meme to a supremely legit pick for normal play, owing to her much improved torp stat and efficiency. The CV/L protection skill is nice to have, too.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/91/Z1KaiChibi.png "KMS Z1") - **[KMS Z1 Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z1#retrofit)** **(T0 if running full Z-series setup)**
* Skill:
  * +40% FP and Eva to all KMS DD.
  * Every 20s, 80% chance to fire a special barrage, gain +50% CritDmg and grant -30% Aviation Damage to the vanguard for 10s.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Desc: 
>Z1 Kai read Z23 Kai's damn book and has learnt an EX barrage of her own, as well as a few other tricks, and as a result can now put out some remarkable DPS of her own while offering some measure of protection from planes.  
Her guns didn't improve all that much, however, so don't forget she's more torp-focused than her peers.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/57/Le_MalinChibi.png "Le Malin") - **[MNF Le Malin](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Le_Malin)**
* Skill:
  * If her Main Gun shots hit an enemy 10 times, that enemy takes +12% dmg from any destroyer in the fleet; also, upon destroying an enemy, Le Malin gains a +2% FP stack, up to 10 stacks.
  * Upon battle start, gain +20% Torp/Eva for 30s; over the next 20s, the buff potency lowers to 0%.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [Optimal] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] 120mm twin; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedoes; 20mm Twin Oerlikon; Toolbox; Toolbox

- Desc:
>Le Malin shares both Le Triomphant's statline and the "hit the same target" gimmick, but makes it a lot more lenient and considerably more effective besides.  
Strong guns and barrage, okay AA and defences, weak torpedoes - all in all, a very solid gunnery DD.
 
### Tier 1.5:

Maury does things differently from many of her colleagues, but she does them well - despite not quite reaching the torp heights of the IJN or the gunnery of the KMS, she strikes a comfortable balance between the two factions and proves a reliable, independent addition to most fleets.

>They finally did it, the madmen. Not only they Kai'd Azur Lane's greatest meme, they even made her the hero she was always supposed to be - sporting one whole extra Main Gun Mount, some much needed markups in Firepower and Efficiency, a shiny new and dazzling (but ultimately not too powerful) barrage and EVEN MORE anti-air capabilities, neither the skies nor the seas present any challenge to the once most unwanted gold unit in the game.  
You'll still want to give her an Oxygen Torpedo or two, though - her torp stat remains abysmal, and even if it's not the torps you're taking her for there's no reason to let them rot. Besides, fireworks go great with a nice, starry night.

>Unlike Hood and Monarch's case, there is no real ambiguity here - Neptune does do Phoenix's job better, although at a considerably higher cost.  
Armed with an excellent AP barrage and a very powerful AP boosting passive, and protected by the largest HP pool in her class and a better version of Phoenix's self-rescue skill, Neptune is perfectly capable of carrying on the fight for much longer while simultaneously making it much shorter than her USS counterpart could do.

With no real weakness to speak of, her one significant flaw is not being able to bolster CA torpedoes - you'll want to look elsewhere for that.

While the power of her debuff is unparalled, it's hard to make sure she will proc when you need her to - either because the enemy has died already or there's no worthy targets on the screen, as tends to happen on mob nodes, or because it just won't proc due to bad luck; only boss fights tend to drag on for long enough to guarantee her debuff will proc and get some use.

>Similar in a few ways to Jintsuu, Sirius offers a spectacular buff to a specific subset of units while benefiting greatly from it herself - significant enough to offset her otherwise unimpressive statline and really get the most out of her DD guns.
Gunnery is her main asset, and her barrage even more so - one of the absolute best as far as vanguards are concerned, very quick and hard-hitting despite the unassuming Normal shells, and unique in its narrowing pattern, which makes landing most of the shots from long range a rather simple task.  
That said, you will need to deploy a few carriers to get the full experience and with her barrage making up a significant portion of her overall DPS, her auto performance will suffer - handle with care.

Ziggy's Kai gave her the statline she needed to compete favourably with the other big-name CL supporters, even if the second skill is kinda lacklustre.

Sporting an impressive 3.8k HP, high Reload, slightly higher than usual Evasion and good guns, Cleve doesn't need skills to make her presence felt on the battlefield and excels as a tank; that said, while her AA skill is more of a detriment than a boon, her fleetwide boost is unreliable but potentially great.

>Dealing more damage than usual with HE guns and packing better torps than every other HMS cruiser, she tends to have a decent answer for most Light and Heavy Armour shaped issues - but not a great one on either side, and her smokescreen is almost entirely useless in PvE with its terrible procrate plus lower defence compared to the 'regular' screen and planes not attacking you.  
That said, the recent introduction of a CL HE gun that deigns itself to fire *straight* singlehandedly makes her considerably more combat-effective, if still lacking in support power.  
Her place is mostly PvP, as there are many other CL who will do what she does - be it DPS or tanking - better for less.

- Desc: Worth her weight in gold.
>Edinburgh is in a similar situation as Cleveland: both have merely 'okay' skills, both have impressive statlines, both will stay in front and tank for days while the rest of the team gets the job done.  
The difference lies in how 'safe' they play things, as Edinburgh gets a passive boost to AP damage inflicted, an even bulkier HP pool (4.1k is amazing for both varieties of Cruiser) and no AA skill to burn her FP, but doesn't get that lone shot at the fleetwide buff and her DPS is still par for the course for a CL.  
Still, there's very few more reliable frontline tanks than she - and that's a definite plus.

Unfortunate, but at least she gets a better deal than the other two loli of the batch - her statline hasn't dropped at all beyond a -400ish HP compared to the real version, and while there's no doubt a stat debuff is a lot worse than *just dealing more damage* to all enemies, it is nevertheless nice to have.  
The AA buff is also okay, as it helps her withstand aerial punishment without into her FP as the Cleveland-class buff does; the lolibote buff isn't, as neither other loli is worth taking along and it only procs when they're around.

As amazing as all this sounds, she is let down by one glaring flaw - her abysmal offensive statline, which even her impressive buff struggles to shore up, compounded with pre-WW1-era engines that grant her the questionable honour of being the slowest ship in the game (tied with Yat Sen).  
All that said, unlike Yat Sen she is certainly usable; okay-ish on her own and an amazing force multiplier, having her around won't cut into your DPS to the point of crippling your fleet and will help your other ships MvP.

- Description: The Great Wall of China.
>Obscenely slow (pre-Kai), pitiful HP and middling torps at best; Yat Sen is somewhat more interesting, with her double guns and twin AA mount, but her statline is severely lacking and has the questionable distinction of being tied with Avrora for slowest unit in the game.  
Nothing about these three looks usable, until you start deploying them together - at which point the sisters start evading better than basically anyone else in the game, even on the Single Line formation, achieveing unrivaled amounts of effective HP while dishing out respectable DPS besides.  
Lots of investment needed and Yat Sen MUST be protected at all costs (hint, place her between Ping and Ning), but they're the ultimate stonewall - if that's what you're looking for, it's worth it.

- Desc:
>Second only to San Diego in terms of sheer AA prowess, she is rather similar in many regards to her pre-Kai iteration.  
Weak gunnery with access to DD guns, weak torpedoes, an AA-focused skill - the differences start with the *two* very high-efficiency AA guns she carries (deftly pushing her over Sandy base as a flyswatter), the way the AA-focused skill works (being more somewhat more reliable but also a lot more selfish) and the much weaker barrage.  
In short, she isn't tough and she isn't powerful - in fact she's really *really* wimpy - but she's an exceptionally accomplished and cheap sky clearer. Worth having around if enemy planes got you down.

In most regards, Minneapolis is indeed a direct step-up from Phoenix: her CA guns massively overpower her predecessor's CL ones, the Medium Armour cuts incoming gunfire damage in half, the heal is somewhat slower but comes with a handy damage resistance buff... but it's the +FP/Rld buff when taking enemies down that's the real deal and kicks her DPS into really high gear, as long as there's targets for her to take down.

While she is definitely less tanky, missing the extra 800 HP and 11 Evasion Port gets, she casts a massive shadow over her DPS thanks to higher Firepower, better Main Gun efficiency, better offensive skills, a much better barrage and, most importantly, still getting Main Gun +1 despite the torps as if she were a gunboat.

- Desc: ROON FOR YOUR LIVES!
> In many ways, Saint Louis and Roon stand at opposite ends.  
Whereas the former starts out strong and loses some of her lustre as the battle drags on, the latter only gets stronger; where the former's barrage is uncomfortably wide, the latter's is very concentrated and devastating; where the former relies on high speed and evasion to stay out of harm's way, the latter simply adds layers of HP and shields to power through the barrages; and as the former gradually mellows out of her cold templar persona, the latter grows ever more violent and unhinged.  
As a result, Roon is best served on boss battles - where she has time to rev up her guns and let the concentrated barrage tear single hard targets apart.

> Historically praised by multiple navies as one of the absolute best heavy cruiser designs but robbed of its chance to shine due to the fall of France in WW2, Azur Lane's Saint Louis has come to set the record straight - and does she ever.  
Mightiest of all CA by weight of stats and skills, there is no area where she doesn't excel - her guns absolutely melt opposing Light Armour and punch through Heavy Armour better than any other frontliners' in the game, her Speed is slightly superior to that of CLs and enjoys a hefty boost to her already high Evasion for more than half a minute after the battle starts, her AA is uncharacteristically high for her class and she enjoys all the perks of her Spe-CA peers (Medium Armour, MGM+1 and Torpedoes).  
The only fault one can find in her would be her barrage - its wide linear pattern helps dispatching multiple weak foes, yes, but also neuters its impact against single targets.

>Hands down the best vanguard tank in the game.  
Portland Kai may be cheap, Prinz Eugen may have more eHP and Roon may have more DPS,  but none of them have her spectacular shields nor her combination of good DPS and high eHP at the same time, and that's what pushes her above her competitors.    
While the damage boosts are undoubtedly good and allow her to perform optimally under every circumstance, the shields are the real stars of the show here - not only their uptime is much higher than the 18% would lead you to believe, able as they are to proc on *any* attack that collides with her chibi (even if she evades the damage), the front-facing shield is absolutely invaluable when it comes to blocking incoming enemy fire entirely, especially if it's piercing enemy fire.  
If you're sick of seeing your poor vanguard get turned inside out, Zara is the solution to your problems.

While her base form has never been bad, performing as well as a Leander Kai at the end of the day, her comparatively high costs and mostly irrelevant niche (buffing DD FP as well as the rest) meant she wouldn't see much use; the Kai does not change this, but it does put her DPS in the big leagues thanks to her new obscenely powerful DD mount and chance for double damage, while the stat gains make her considerably tougher beside; the +Acc stacks are nice but not particularly important as vanguards don't really struggle landing hits but more crits are appreciated nonetheless.  
Given all this, London Kai proudly joins Wichita and Choukai in their exclusive "best and most useful CA club" and does so with finesse.

>Expectations surrounding Azuma were high, considering we'd been asking for a "frontline BB" sorts for ages and she seemed to fit the bill perfectly - but alas, they were not matched and both disappointment and hyperbole ran rampant, mucking everything up.  
That disappointment is borne of two simple elements: one, her being a DR like Freidrich while being closer to old PR1 CAs in power than her, and two, her absurd *16* Oil price tag. Both are very valid reasons to feel cheated out of a great unit.  
Does this mean she's bad? No, in fact she's a very good cruiser with an edge against shield-heavy lategame scenarios, easy to heal and hard to shift as she lobs fiery death across the screen, but she is indeed overcosted and grinding her up to the point where she can truly perform takes ages.

* Desc: 
>The pride and joy of the Takao-class, she's the only one who actually bothers buffing her sisters (as well as other cruisers) and gets that guns are better than torpedoes for heavy cruisers; as a result, she's a notch above her sisters and most Torp-CA.

  * +15% damage vs Sirens.
  * Has TWO preloaded torpedo spreads.

- Desc: What do you mean "she's not a DD"?
> Someone at the design bureau must've missed a memo when they designed Ibuki.  
Sporting an IJN DD's skillset and an IJN CA's statline, by all rights she should be a failure on both accounts - but against all odds, she ends up taking both's best attributes and only few of the flaws.  
Her IJN DD side shines through her double preloaded torpedo spreads, the ludicrous 185% Torpedo Efficiency and entirely Torpedo-focused skills (including, if Fated, a neat +Eva buff on torpedo launch); her IJN CA side comes to the fore during the lulls inbetween torpedo strikes, as she falls back on her remarkable Torp-CA gunnery and sturdy frame to keep up the offensive.  
That said, however, she's much more of a DD than a CA - to perform at her best she needs Oxygen Torpedoes, which limit her survivability (in comparison to other CAs at least, she's still considerably tougher than most IJN DDs), as well as suitable targets, which restricts her use cases to Sirens and bosses or alternatively particularly menacing mobs.
Still, as long as you employ her for the surgical strikes she's made for, she has little to no rivals in her field.

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/7/78/ChicagoChibi.png "USS Chicago") - **[USS Chicago](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Chicago)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon firing the Main Gun, 30% chance to have it deal +100% Damage. (Has an internal cooldown of 5s; do not give her the 203Mle as the gun will reload in under 5s.)

* Desc: 
>What was said about Wichita applies to Chicago as well. Slightly frailer than she is and needing RNG to get the most out of her, she will nonetheless punch very hard - and harder than anyone else when she procs.
Also worth mentioning, if she procs on her first salvo, the buff affects the second one too - which means that all in all, her actual procrate is 49%!

* Skill: 
  * 20% chance upon Main Gun fire to gain +100% Eva for 15s.

- Desc: "Problem? What problem?"
> While an Evasion-focused CA sounds ludicrous, and it is under most circumstances, Houston actually makes it work given enough Evasion-boosting auxiliaries: CAs live and die by their Evasion (or lack thereof), so stacking it actually lets her survive under heavy fire for much longer than you'd expect.  
What issues she does have are fairly minor: she needs to proc to get tough, obviously, but her uptime is high and she has two chances to proc per firing cycle; and her damage output isn't as high as it could be, since her only skill is that Evasion buff, but it's still higher than most non-CA (and many Torp-CA) frontliners manage.

  * Take -20% damage from DD/CL gun attacks.

* Desc: 
>Sporting a matching set of Medium Armour, anti-DD/CL gunfire skills and considerable AA capabilities, the New Orleans-class CAs focus more on the defence than the offence, unlike almost every other CA in the USS.  
A good fit for mob- as well as boss-hunting, considering how frequent are DD and CL bosses, but beware their weaker guns and the need to take Astoria to make the most out of them.

* Skill:
  * Each time Suzuya's Main Gun lands 8 hits (not consecutively, each shell counts as 1 hit), gain 1 stack of +5% Firepower and +25% Reload up to a maximum of 3 stacks; upon gaining max stacks, her barrage improves (gains two lines of 4 AP shots in a tight cone).
  * Take -20% AP damage.
  * Can take a CL gun, but shouldn't.

* Desc: 
>CAs aren't known for their barrages, but Suzuya isn't going to let that get her down.   
Blessed with one of the best vanguard barrages currently available once upgraded, and bolstered by buffs that naturally improve both her ability to barrage and the barrage itself, she's uniquely positioned to take advantage of an otherwise ignored feature of this class without sacrificing actual gunnery in the process.  
On the flipside, said barrage is also her *only* noteworthy feature - manual play is almost mandatory in order to play to her strength.

  * May equip the 283mm SKC28, but shouldn't.

- Desc: 
>Too large for mere CA and too small for proper BCs, these Pocket Battleships are odd creatures.  
Capable of mounting a unique underchambered BB gun, they sport massive amounts of Firepower, a wide and severely damaging barrage and a raging hatred for anyone smaller than they (DD and CL) - but are let down by that same gun's AP element (which underperforms against DD and CL), their lower-than-average Speed and Evasion, and the weak torpedoes they're stuck with.  
A wrecking ball against small craft, to be sure, but watch out for when they pick a fight with people her size - and place Spee at the front, as she is slightly tankier than her sister.

* Skill:
  * Gain +6% FP for every other Kizuna unit in the fleet, up to +24%; if no other Kizuna unit is present, take -15% dmg for 30s after the start of the battle. (Pyoko-Pyoko aux lets a "normal" unit count as Kizuna)
  * Ignitions sustained last for -3s and reduces incoming HE damage by 15%.

* Desc: 
>A sturdy gunboat with remarkable firepower. Sounds familiar? 
Her direct competitor would be Portland Kai, and while she comes out of that comparison looking pretty weak (lower eHP, the extra FP comes at the expense of higher Oil costs, the lack of a barrage and the need to take at least 2+ Kizunas to outgun her), she is nonetheless a tough nut to crack and she can pack a good punch.

  * Upon taking damage, 8% chance to halve that damage.

* Desc: 
>The CA you'll use the most early on, thanks to her high staying power and her simply being a gunboat.

* Skill: 
  * +15% FP to all CL/CA in the fleet.

* Desc: 
>What you use when you don't have Wichita but still want a powerful, buff-capable CA.  
She will be phased out eventually, alas, but she's good while she's there and you can still use her to augment a second fleet.

* Skill: 
  * +15% FP to the entire vanguard.

* Desc: 
>HMS CA get a bad reputation for being frail and either undergunned or undertorped, despite possessing rather valuable skills.   
London is one such example, but she rescues herself from the mediocrity of her statline by virtue of being one of the only two frontliners that can buff DD FP - a small niche, admittedly, but a useful one if you plan on fielding multiple DD with good guns.

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/bf/YorkKaiChibi.png "HMS York Kai") - **[HMS York Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/York#retrofit)**

  * Upon performing ANY attack (autoguns, main guns, torpedoes; AA does not count), 40% chance to gain +40% FP for 8s.
  * Take -40% damage from suicide boats and -15% damage from HE; additionally, her autoguns gain +70% CritRate and ignore armour modifiers.

* Desc: 
>It speaks volumes about HMS non-CL vanguards that the best they can aspire to is not be irredeemable wrecks.  
York Kai is one of the lucky few worthy of such lofty praise, managing to scrape by virtue of an exceptional self-buff and a Kai that gives her the sorely needed FP to make some actual use out of said skill; the second skill is an alright boost, pushing her autoguns into the realm of "kinda sorta decent" and slightly bolstering her defences, but don't be deceived by her Medium Armour and high Evasion, a tank she ain't and her abysmal luck makes sure she can't play the part for long.  
All that said, though - she's alright.

* Skill: Increases Reload by 35% and 30% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch

* Desc: 
>Maya trades Takao's double damage chance for a permanent passive reload boost. An interesting concept, and paired with double Autoloaders lets her fire her guns and torps faster than any other CA, which is remarkable on its own right... but is a rather poor trade nonetheless.
Also, she's slightly better at AA than her sisters (key word being "slightly", though).

  * 8% chance to reduce any damage taken by 50% on taking damage

- Desc: "HAAH?!"
>Damage control is about lowering the incoming damage as much as it is about preventing it in the first place, and Hipper learns the right lesson from Prinz Eugen - despite her much lower HP, Hipper's superior offensive statline and slightly improved tanking skills let her fulfil her role better and for cheaper.

* Desc: 
>It's exceedingly rare for a frontliner to have more HP than carriers and battlecruisers, but Prinz Eugen makes it happen. Proud owner of a HP pool larger than 90% of the ships in the game, she pays for this priviledge by being saddled with a semi-useless skill and poor offensive stats.

* Desc: 
>Georgia is a simple woman - she sees a big gun, she barrages.  
There's really not much to say about her. Very straightforward USS BB, sporting the characteristically excellent AA of her peers and their same DD guns; her most remarkable feature the fact her barrage is both absolute murder *and* aimed, meaning it can be used from the sidelines with no loss in performance whatsoever, as well as her lacking one Main Gun Mount (which is partially made up for by the high Main Gun Efficiency).

  * Enemies hit by Duke of York's Main Gun fire take +12% damage from all sources for 8s; also, her first volley deals x1.5 damage.

  * Once per battle and upon falling below 20% HP, restore 3% HP every 2s for 8s; also, for every 1% HP lost during the fight, her Reload increases by 1.

- Desc: 
>It'd be easy to regard Monarch as a straight upgrade to Hood. She mounts CL guns, Her FP is much higher, her Efficiencies are better, her barrage is AP and she can even heal herself... what more could one possibly want from a battleship?
The truth isn't quite so simple, though. While Monarch's statline is indeed superior (with the glaring exception of AA) and the self-heal greatly extends her operational time even beyond Hood's already impressive one, Monarch's barrage will neither quicken the backline's pace nor can it be used with the same reckless abandon due to the AP modifiers; while she won't fall flat against Light Armour, courtesy of her excellent regular shelling, she doesn't quite match Hood's supportive capabilities and weight of fire.
As a result, it would be wise to pick your sovereign of choice with an eye to battlefield conditions - if enemy BB/C are out for blood or Medium/Heavy Armour is getting you down, Monarch will weather their storm and put them in their place with staggering ease.

- Desc: If you can't decide what to pick, pick it all.
>Packing offensive buffs for her enemies, defensive buffs for her backline, a barrage that includes normal arcing shells alongside linear AP shells and even aimed torpedoes, Amagi has quite literally a bit of everything in herself; and it all comes together as one sleek and effective whole, only marginally hampered by her IJN standard terrible AA.

- Desc: The terror of the Seven Seas.
>As befitting of a pirate queen, Jean Bart doesn't play by the rules: while lacking a third salvo would be a net loss on a dreadnought's effectiveness on the field, Jean makes up for it in spades by showing up to the fight with her horrifically overcharged guns already loaded, resulting in damage spikes that would make Ayanami blush.
Volume of fire is ultimately maintained by her gun, firing a respectable 8 shots in total, and cooldowns aren't a concern either thanks to her higher-than-normal Reload; whatever she's facing, it's heading straight to Davy Jones' locker.
Absolutely devastating, and unlike Tirpitz she has no compunctions about fellow dreadnoughts. The Jolliest Roger of them all.

>Freddy is broken as fuck. Enough said, moving on.  
What, you want more? Fine. Freddy Mercury is unreasonably strong and, unlike Azuma, fully deserving of her status as a DR (and disgusting ***19*** Oil cost) brimming as she in the sheer staying power granted by her escalating defence buff and nearly 10k base HP as well as firepower, courtesy of the devastating 160% Main Gun Efficiency she gets without sacrificing gun mounts or an easily-procced, powerful defensive barrage.  
If one were to look really hard for any chinks in her Plot Armour it could be said that her HitRate is abysmal, not that BBs exactly shine in that regard; nevertheless she's uncharacteristically bad in that regard, suffering from the PR standard 0 Luck and a meagre 65 Accuracy, but it's an easily solved issue anyway.

- Desc:
>As befitting a mecha musume, Gascogne is shockingly efficient and stable - and it's not even entirely the heal's doing.  
No, while the heal (and the defensive buff it comes stock with) are definitely very appreciated, the real stars of the show here are both the guaranteed barrage fired every 20s and the way in which her main guns fire, ensuring that every shell will land on priority target no matter how fast it moves.  
These are all very desirable characteristics for a mob fleet flagships, but don't forget that her gunnery is more than good enough to earn her a place in a boss fleet as well if need be - an effective 220%+ Efficiency is horrifyingly devastating, all you have to do is take the shot yourself.

- Desc: The Queen's Royal Corgi.
>Well, the Kai's come and gone, and Warspite's left in a slightly better position than she originally was - as far as PvE is concerned, at least.  
While her statline did enjoy a substantial offensive boost in the form of more stats, chief among which her truly absurd 125 Accuracy (roughly twice that of most BBs), higher Efficiencies and a strong passive skill, her new-and-improved barrage suffers from the same unreliability that torpedoed her shot(s) at glory - as powerful as those AP shells now are, they're still all too likely to be fired at Light targets (or worse, at fireboats), while the marker part of barrage appears to be bafflingly ineffectual, as evidenced both by *HMS BB/C still opening fire on unmarked targets* and by the possibility of *multiple markers coexisting, negating the supposed benefits*.  
On the bright side, Warspite's newfound strength lets her be competitive there once more in the PvP areans, where her intended targets are always armoured, immobile and valuable.

>A well-rounded warship on her own right compared to her dakka-centric senpai, her set of buffs is about as good as those provided by Mikasa but she needs the flagship slot even more due to her barrage.
Place her there and she'll carry your IJN carrier division to glory and triumph; place her to the sides and she's merely okay.

  * +15% FP to the entire backline.

* Desc: 
>THE cost-effective BB in the game, bar none. No other battleship can boast a Firepower as high as hers, nor can they buff their colleagues' Firepower while they're at it - and Hyuuga does all this at the low, low price of 13 Oil.

* Skill: 
  * The first salvo of her every volley always crits; also extends the range of any CL gun equipped to 90 units (= white line that pushes you back when approached), but reduces their damage by 35%.
  * If flagship, 70% chance to fire a weak barrage (4 shots to the centre of the screen, 2 shots to each side, some mid-ranged DD pellets in the middle); also, passively raise KMS carrier damage by 20%.
  * Grant +20% CritRate to the guns/torpedoes/planes used by KMS units, grant +12% Reload to all KMS units, grant Tirpitz +40% Damage.

* Desc: Here comes Tutorial Girl!
>At long last the wehraboos can rejoice - Bismarck has arrived, and she's every bit as good as they'd hoped.  
Positively brimming in buffs for herself as well as her countrywomen, her sole presence is enough to kick all their weaponry into overdrive, having them shoot harder and slightly faster, while their carriers (all one/two of them) enjoy a massive Nagato-like damage injection and Tirpitz finally overcomes her social anxiety with oneesan around.
Her own guns are no strangers to buffs either, with guaranteed crits on every first salvo of every volley and massively extended CL secondary ranges (at the cost of 1/3 less damage); the former buff easily steals the spotlight, but the range extension allows her to lend a hand to a vanguard that's in over its head (or take potshots at vanguards in PvP).  
Last and least, she has a barrage too. It's not particularly good, but it's there and no other KMS backliner has a better one, so have her be the flag.

    * The 9 SHELLS deal 170 bdmg with 50/120/115 mods; the 30 DD PELLETS deal 20 bdmg with 120/60/60 mods (and have 50 Range). The damage of both is modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * Gain a persistent stack of +2.5% FP per enemy node destroyed, and gain a temporary stack +2.5% FP per enemy destroyed in battle (up to a cap of 17.5%, meaning that Alabama starts with more stacks the more nodes she fights but still can't go past +17.5%); also, after the 5th destroyed node, the backline takes -8% damage.

- Desc: Washington 2: The Blackening.
>Take Washington, upgrade her barrage to AP and slightly raise its procrate, get rid of the useless synergy and replace it with an actually good set of self-buffs, and voil√† - you have Alabama, a steamroller of a mob fleet flagship.  
While she can work on boss fleets, so long as she gets some kills before it spawns and nobody else wants the flag slot, she's better off playing to her strengths.

  * -15% incoming aviation damage to the backline as long as North Carolina is alive and in the fleet
  * Increase FP by 30% of her total AA stat (buffs not included)

- Desc: 
>Anti-air for backliners is a bit of a meme, but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one.  
North Carolina goes harder than anyone else on the AA front, as far as backliners are concerned - not only does she prevent plane damage with her skill, she also grows stronger the more AA she acquires (and she's plenty strong to begin with, sporting a very high base FP thanks to said skill).  
Whether you do actually need all that AA is another matter entirely, but rest assured that she will lay on the hurt even if you don't - and if you do, that's just gravy.

  * 50% chance on Main Gun fire to launch a special barrage (long range: tight 4-shot wave, tight 4-shot wave with 2 shots to the sides; short range: wide V-shaped spread of small bullets)
  * 10s after battle start and every 20s, afterwards, launches a torpedo barrage (2 lines of 2 aimed torps).

- Desc: A sidegrade to Washington.
>Sturdier, more powerful, better armed and in possession of a much more useful synergy (Akagi still gets her +35% Aviation buff with her) in PvE, BB Kaga - affectionately called "Baga" - does however forfeit some reliability on her enhanced barrage and is stuck with an atrocious AA stat.  
She also has a few torps to throw out every now and then, but they're fairly lacklustre.

  * (Kai) On first airstrike, launch additional Zuiun.

* Desc: 
>The second most cost-effective BBs in the game, owing to their remarkable statline, Kai nodes and comparatively low Oil costs.  
Their Kai is unique in that it is a sidegrade rather than an upgrade: when turned into BBV, they trade their CL guns and 1/3 of their BB salvo for seaplanes, letting them launch airstrikes as if they were carriers.  
A steep price to pay, especially considering how weak the seaplanes are in comparison to 'proper' bombers, how slow the launches are in comparison to 'proper' carriers and how much better are Ise and Hyuuga as BBVs.

- Desc: Slow but steady...
>One of the most consistent and hardest hitting BBs in the game, provided you cater to her social anxiety.  
While not as flashy as her competition, Tirpitz is, in a way, the "safe" choice - her abilities can't misfire, her defensive statlines makes her tougher than most and her damage buff extends to both her CL guns and torpedo spread, ensuring that even at 0 Ammo she will still be able to strike and defend herself with remarkable effectiveness.
However, all this becomes quickly irrelevant as soon as she loses her +30% damage buff as it the main reason behind her power; without it she has very little reason to be used and will be easily outshone by pretty much everyone.   

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/52/LittorioChibi.png "Littorio") - **[RN Littorio](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Littorio)**

    * The 6/9 SHELLS deal 174 bdmg with 40/125/125 mods; the 20 NEEDLE LASERS deal 20 bdmg with 120/60/60 mods. The damage of both is modified by 100% of the unit's FP.
  * Upon battle start, generate 2 anti-torp shields in front of Littorio and the vanguard lead, each able to tank up to 2 hits; also, gain +20% FP for the first 3 battles in a sortie.

* Recommended Loadouts:

- Desc: 
>Azur Lane's Littorio doesn't quite match her historical acclaim as one of the best warships of her time but she's still very good, especially as a mauler of lategame Medium/Heavy Armour formations.  
Blessed with an overall very good statline (Accuracy aside), a strong AP barrage and a hefty FP buff for the first three fights in a sortie, Littorio looks similar enough to Alabama but approaches mobbing in a different way - whereas Alabama gets stronger with each fight and therefore benefits from chewing up easier nodes first, Littorio wants to demolish the toughest opposition first and then move onto easier stuff.
The anti-torp shields are nice enough too, but not much of a gamechanger considering her job description - speaking of which, unlike Alabama you *could* use her as a boss fleet flag without throwing away part of her skillset, but the less concentrated barrage means she's at her best whem she's fighting more mobile Medium/Heavy bosses who may or may not have adds too.
*About her gun...* it's an interesting piece of kit, with its +10% Damage for the first two volleys, but it only really works on Littorio or when hunting Sirens (assuming you don't have BB with preloaded/accelerated volleys).

* Skill:
  * Gain +30% Main Gun CritRate and increase her Main Gun Scatter by +1; also, 70% chance every 16s to fire a special barrage (very scattershot single large AP shots and torpedoes).
  * Gain +25% Evasion and Accuracy.

- Desc: An upgrade to Washington.
>Though she may not look much like the part, BB AI does live up to her title; between the very significant crit boost (for which the +1 scatter may as well not be there, insubstantial as it is), the hilariously scattershot but poweful barrage clearing the field for the Main Guns and access to CL defensive guns, there's very little not to like here.  
The Accuracy and Evasion boosts are nice to have, too, but not exactly worthy of prime time - especially as the +Acc ends up compensating for her lower-than-usual base stat.
 
### Tier 1.5:

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/46/MassachusettsChibi.png "USS Massachusetts") - **[USS Massachusetts](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Massachusetts)**
* Skill: 
  * Gain +5% FP/AA/Evasion for every OTHER USS BB/CA in the fleet, up to +15%.
  * Main Gun ammo is overrideen to SHS (60/135/115, shells fire at extremely high angles and fall from the sky) and salvo damage increases the farther the shots land, up to +30% dmg.

* Desc: Massachusetts shoots for the stars, but the aim isn't quite there. 
>On paper she'd easily be T1 material, as the self-buffs are both significant and easily achieved while the enhanced AP modifiers allow her to damage Light Armour... but firing into the stratosphere lengthens the shots' travel time to the point where she struggles hitting at all, making the gains pretty much moot.  
If you can guarantee your target won't be moving around much at all and is bigger than a CL, a very solid pick; if you can't, best look elsewhere.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/80/South_DakotaChibi.png "USS South Dakota") - **[USS South Dakota](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/South_Dakota)**

  * 30% chance to do double damage when firing main gun

* Desc: 
>While her tanking skill isn't good enough to make her the tank she's meant to be, she is undeniably hard to kill thanks to her large HP pool and all-around excellent stats, AA included (a rarity among BB/Cs); her double damage proc needs RNG to work, but when it does it will annihilate whatever she aimed at.

  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a strong barrage (mid-ranged conal machinegun sweep, long range focused bombardment)
  * When South Dakota's HP falls to/below 30%, South Dakota gains Protection (avoid lethal damage for 5s) while Washington deals +20% damage and absorbs 30% of the damage sustained by South Dakota.

- Desc: Smile for the FCR!
>An upgunned, uparmoured and upcosted Pennsylvania with some minor synergy.  
As expensive a price tag as 15 Oil is, Washington makes up for it with a slightly better statline (AA aside, which basically doubles) and an improved barrage with some mob-clearing power - as well as a defensive synergy with South Dakota, which sees more usage in PvP than it does in PvE as it hinges on Sodak risking destruction, something you should and most likely can avoid in the first place.

* Desc: 
>(PvE) Airstrike murderer extraordinaire thanks to her barrage, accomplished fireboat slayer owing to her CL guns on a BC frame, and even gets an edge against the most threatening enemies you can face later on.
A very solid defensive pick, further helped by the fact her Sanshikidan barrage doesn't need her to be in the flagship slot to do work.

* Desc: Kongou-class support craft. Not very flashy, but her buffs are anything but unremarkable - the extra Evasion in particular makes a Kongou-class backline powerful and extremely hard to shift.

A force to be reckoned with, especially considering her cost, but don't count on the torps to do much more than stop the occasional fireboat.

  * Every 20s, launch 3 unguided torpedoes in a cone.

* Desc: 
>Think Warspite, except with a functional barrage and less showboating. Between her regular guns, the CL secondaries, the automated barrage and the torps, she will throw out damage more often than any other backliner in the game.  
A force to be reckoned with, just like her sister; and just like her sister, don't count on her torps at all.

* Desc: 
>By most intents and purposes, a discount South Dakota who gives up her bigger, blacker sister's AA capabilities, a portion of her statline and her shield for a lower Oil cost.   
Still hits damn hard, though, and harder still when she's on a good roll.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/61/PennsylvaniaChibi.png "USS Pennsylvania") - **[USS Pennsylvania](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Pennsylvania)**
* Skill: 
  * 20s 60% chance, fires a special barrage (4 salvo of 3 shots barraging bombarding the middle of the screen, Normal modifiers)

* Desc: 
>Often overlooked in favour of other barrage ships (eg. Hood, Washington), Pennsylvania plays it different from many others by having a timed proc instead of a main-gun-fire-based one.  
While this means you can equip whichever BB gun you'd like to stick on her, it also means that she may proc when you don't need her to and waste the barrage.  
A bit fiddly, but arguably more flexible than most and just as powerful.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/5f/King_George_VChibi.png "King George V") - **[HMS King George V](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/King_George_V)** **(T1 if deployed w/ 3 OTHER HMS units)**
* Skill: 
  * Every 24s, 70% chance to fire a mediocre barrage (6/8 spread out shots + thin V-shaped wave of parallel needles); if KGV mounts a 356mm Quad, reduce the cooldown of her first volley by 75%, gain +20% CritChance on main gun shots, reduce its scatter by 2 and enhance the barrage (slightly better damage, 8 large shots instead of 6).
  * Deal +10% Damage to IJN/KMS/RM/Siren units; if sortied with 3 other HMS units, gain +20% FP/AA/Reload/Evasion.
  
* Desc: Takes a King to put an upstart Prince in its place.
>Heh, typical nobles. Profiting from their underlings and giving next to nothing in return.  
While KGV is yet another sovereign that doesn't buff back her fellow countrywomen, there's no denying the buff she receives from them is both quite simple to attain (the HMS is spoiled for good backline choices) and substantial; not only that, her damage buff is hardly ever out of a job considering 99% of the enemies in PvE are IJN.  
As for the 356mm, long story short - it only overtakes the good ol' 406MK6 if her first volley lands most of its shots and hits something valuable, otherwise the long cooldown and the subpar damage eventually catch up to her; it won't cripple her but she won't benefit a whole lot from it either, and her barrage is fairly anaemic anyway so buffing it isn't too desirable a prospect.  
In short, she's a big burly beatstick that'll benefit from having some HMS cheerleaders around. Only let her be the flag if nobody else has a better barrage.

* Desc: Consistently bad.
>One really has to wonder what has Izumo ever done to developers to warrant such a treatment.
As awful in AL as she is in WoWS, Izumo is bad by any standard - her barrage barely scratches Light Armour while being unable to bypass it due to the parallel shots, her 'defensive' skill harms her much more than it does protect her due to the complete absence of enemy BB AP (and prevalence of BB HE), and worse still, as a barrage boat she needs flagship slot... while sharing Mikasa and Nagato's nation.
Her sole saving grace is her exceptional statline, and even then it is marred by high Oil costs, comparatively low Efficiencies and is far from making any significant difference.  
The improvements to her barrage brought by a full Fate Sim aren't just an addition - they are a necessity in order to make it work.
Bad not just by PR standards but as a whole, there is little to no reason to ever use her over any other barrage boat.

  * 60% chance upon Main Gun fire, grant all BB/C +20% damage output for 8s.
  * If equipping the "Z Flag" auxiliary item, grant +5% Firepower/Accuracy to the entire fleet.

* Desc: Pint-sized dai-senpai.
>While her HP might be low and she may lack an AA gun, she does make up for it in spades through a superb Reload stat and astoundingly good buffs.  
An iffy pick on her own, but a monstrous force multiplier for other IJN BB/Cs and no slouch herself.

* Skill: 
  * 50% chance on Main Gun fire, launch a fixed linear HE barrage (2 tight columns of 4 HE shells and a few needles to the sides).
  * Starts the battle with a preloaded volley, but has MGM-1.

* Desc: The predecessor to Jean Bart, and it does show.
>Like Jean, she lacks her third salvo and can launch her bombardment immediately; unlike Jean, said bombardment operates just like any other and is considerably weaker as a result, while her barrage fires on a coin toss.  
All that said, she'll always get to fire one more volley per round than 99% of the other dreadnoughts and her gun efficiency is very high.  
Decent, all things considered.

     * The 10 SHELLS deal 140 bdmg with 135/85/70 modifiers; the 14 NEEDLES deal 30 bdmg with 100/8'/0 modifiers. Their damage is modified by 100% of the unit's FP stat.
  * 10s after the start of the battle, launch a torpedo barrage (gif pending); then, 5s after the Main Gun has been fired for the first time in the battle, gain +15% FP, deal +20% damage vs CL and set her torp stat to 0.

* Desc: Museum piece, broken out.
>Giulio Cesare's status as a WW1-era dreadnought is made very apparent by her lacking statline, as well as the hilarious amount of shots the puts out when barraging; and while they are solid shots, by most indications, they're still tied to a coinflip you'd rather not make if you could help it.  
Still, she's an alright BB and well suited to dispatching the very common CL hull class.

* Skill: Every 20s, 60% chance to fire a special barrage.

- Desc: "The poor man's Barrage Boat."
>A description partly in jest, and partly absolutely accurate - compared to a normal BB, they are incredibly frail (barely 3k HP with Light Armour) and considerably weaker (low FP, slightly lower Efficiency, one less salvo per volley), but they also cost a fraction than what they do and still get truly impressive barrages.  
How does this come together? As pint-sized discount-costed powerhouses for early world farming, that's how: while low, their Firepower is enough to stop fireboats in their tracks, and if given enough Evasion, they can be reliably expected to evade incoming BB salvo, prolonging their operational time much beyond what their abysmal statline would lead you to believe.  
Monitors can be expected to auto their way up to W8 or 9 with little resistance. Any further, though, and auto becomes almost impossible as enemies get more accurate, tougher and more powerful: the moment a BB opens up on them, they're already dead.
 
#### ![BM](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/bc/NelsonChibi.png "HMS Nelson") ![BM](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/ca/RodneyChibi.png "HMS Erebus") - [HMS Nelson](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nelson) [HMS Rodney](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Rodney)
* Skill: 40% chance to fire a special barrage when firing main gun.

- Desc: "Newbie traps."
>So you just started playing and found these two BBs. Their barrages fire lasers everywhere and melt mobs and they look pretty tough, so they've gotta be good, right?  
Well, no, not really. It'll be like that only early on, where enemies tend to fall to a stiff breeze anyway, but the moment they're faced by serious opposition and normal (eg. 1.5k / 2k HP per trash mob) HP pools, the weaknesses of said barrage quickly come to the fore: low proc rate, proc fixed to main gun fire (which means having to take faster and weaker guns to fish for said procs), super-wide pattern subject to massive scatter and unable to hit what's directly in front of them, poor armour modifiers and poor base damage.  
In short, their barrage is the only notable feature they have - and it's both unreliable and weak.  
Avoid.

#### ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b3/ColoradoChibi.png "USS Colorado") ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c1/West_VirginiaChibi.png "USS West Virginia") ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/a/a9/MarylandChibi.png "USS Maryland") - [USS Colorado](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Colorado) [USS West Virginia](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/West_Virginia) [USS Maryland](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Maryland)
* Skill: 
  * 40% chance to fire a special barrage when firing main gun
  * (Maryland) When her HP drops below 70% increase her damage dealt based on how low her HP is, up to +35%.

- Desc: "The pits."
>You know what was just said about Nelson and Rodney? Well, they're even worse, courtesy of their weaker statlines and lack of CL guns; as for Maryland's +Dmg on low HP, it goes without saying that if you're taking damage, you're in an undesirable situation to begin with.  
Outgunned, outskilled, outcosted. With no hyperbole, they ARE the worst BBs in the game.

### Tier 0:

 ![BBV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b9/HyuugaKaiChibi.png "Hyuuga Kai") - **[IJN Hyuuga Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hyuuga#Retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * Grant +15% FP to the backline.
  * Gain +20% FP.
  * 10s after battle start, 10s cooldown after each use and used only when an enemy gets too close, fire 4 converging CA shells.
 
* Desc: 
>The only aviation battleship to improve in every possible respect after her Kai, the new-and-improved Hyuuga doesn't only sport the customary brutal firepower and enough Main Gun Efficiency to thorougly brutalize what she hits despite the loss of one gun mount, but also retains good self-defence capabilities with her protective barrage.   
The seaplanes are still middling at best, but you're paying no price for a BB with access to a screenclear - that's more than good enough.


 ### Tier 0.5:

   ![BBV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/26/IseKaiChibi.png "Ise Kai") - **[IJN Ise Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ise#Retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * Gain +20% FP.
  * Ise Kai's first two airstrikes have their cooldown reduced by 25% and launch 2 Suisei dive bombers; if a CV/L is present in the fleet, these bonuses remain active.

* Desc: 
>Still the more powerful yet less useful sibling, Ise Kai fully embraces her nature as an instrument of destruction by improving her airstrikes to the point of respectability.
Damage's still not on par with proper carriers, sure, but it's leagues better than what other BBVs gets in terms of both damage and cooldown - and the only thing better than a screenclear is a screenclear that can take out some enemies alongside the bullets.


 ### (Dis)honourable Mentions:

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/9a/YamashiroKaiChibi.png "Yamashiro Kai") ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/0/05/FusouKaiChibi.png "Fusou Kai") - **[IJN Yamashiro Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yamashiro#retrofit)** **[IJN Fusou Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fusou#retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * +20% FP to self.
  * On first airstrike, launch additional Zuiun.

* Desc: 
>So this was already mentioned in the BB section, but to reiterate - Yamashiro and Fusou really get the short end of the stick here.  
Their gains in term of Firepower and Efficiency are not only insufficient to properly compensate for the MGM-1 (loss of 1/3 salvo), they're vastly outgunned by their superior BBV brethren; and their special BBV skill is a Zuiun airstrike that falls well short of even weak CVL airstrikes.  
In short, they're by all accounts a downgrade over their BB forms. Avoid like the plague.

 ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/ed/EssexChibi.png "USS Essex") - **[USS Essex](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Essex)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, launches a tight horizontal line of eight additional TBDs armed with parallel, Flooding-inflicting torps; also, deal +10% damage vs BBs.
  * Increases her own AA and Airpower by 5% for every USS CV/L in the fleet, and increases her own Airpower by 3% whenever her planes shoot down an enemy aircraft (to a maximum of +15% Airpower).
  * If the fleet contains 4 or more USS ships, the entire fleet has a 12% chance to reduce incoming aircraft torpedo and bomb damage to 1.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Boasting a statline rivaled only by that of Enterprise, graced by even more Efficient planes (especially her 140% Fighters), armed to the teeth with skills further boosting that statline, a squadron of DoT-inflicting torpedo bombers and a fleet-wide chance to outright negate incoming aircraft damage, she is meant to give even the Foxes (or W12's plane swarms) pause for thought - and manages to do so with gusto.  
What keeps her from true greatness is how strictly she enforces a specific compositon for your backline to make the most of her skills - US carriers only might not be a bad thing per se, but it severely limits your choices. Her second skill being susceptible to killsteals by allied carriers or AA, and her third skill being nigh-on useless in PvE, doesn't help matters either.  
All that said, when she's good, she's REALLY good.
 
 ![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/f7/CentaurChibi.png "Centaur") - **[HMS Centaur](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Centaur)**
* Skill: 
  * Deal +10% damage vs BB; also, upon airstrike launch, deploy a volley of highly damaging, slowing (-40% speed for 6s), criss-crossing torpedoes from Swordfish planes.
  * Upon airstrike launch, grant +15% Aviation and +10% Firepower to the backline for 8s.
  * Has a 4/0/4 loadout.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] F6F Hellcat; F6F Hellcat; Ryusei; Hydraulic Catapult; Hydraulic Catapult
  * [Poverty] F4U Corsair; F4U Corsair; Tenzan; Hydraulic Catapult; Hydraulic Catapult

* Desc: Centaur is the best generalist the game has to offer among its backliners.
>Aircraft got you down? Here's 4 Figthers, backed up by high Airpower and good efficiencies.  
Need to squeeze out some more damage? Her Swordfishes and 'conventional' torp bombers are pretty brutal.  
Backline could use some buffs or packing BBV? Whether it's carriers or battleships OR BOTH, she's got them (and herself) covered.  
Enemy ships are zipping around too much for your liking? Her Swordfishes inflict Slow and throw out two walls of crisscrossing torps, so they can have fun with that.  
Subs? Don't let her stats fool you, she's still a CVL and that means she can bomb them with impunity (and great effect at that).  
Whatever's getting you down, Centaur has the solution for it - and while she won't match the heights of more specalized units in their fields, her responses tend to be more than enough for most tasks at hand.

  * Gain +15% Aviation and grant +15% efficiency to equipped Fairey Albacores; also, if equipped with at least one Fairey Albacore, launch a plane barrage (gif pending).
    * The 12 PARALLEL TORPEDOES deal 240 bdmg with 80/110/130 modifiers and a 80% chance to Flood for 8s. They are dropped by 2 ALBACORES in 2 separate diagonal waves of 6 parallel torpedoes each, and are modified by 120% of the unit's Aviation stat.
  * Upon airstrike launch, 80% (or 100% if first airstrike of the battle) chance to stop all enemies in place for 1.5s; stopped enemies regain their regular speed over the following 2.5s.
  * Take -8% damage; upon airstrike launch, the other backliners take -8% damage for 10s.
  * Has a 2/0/6 or 0/2/6 loadout.

  * [Mob fighting] F6F Hellcat; Ryusei; Albacore; Hydraulic Catapult; Hydraulic Catapult
  * [Poverty] F4U Corsair; Tenzan; Tenzan or Albacore; Hydraulic Catapult; Hydraulic Catapult

* Desc: <insert overused jojo reference here>
>Unable to accept the fact she's overweight, Formidable insists that everyone be as *lumbering* as her. Rude.  
Pettiness aside, Formidable is definitely true to her name - not so much because of her damage output, which remarkable as it is still doesn't beat some of the bigger names out there, but because of the invaluable support her stop offers.  
Locking an enemy in place for a whole second and a half is more than enough for most big guns to get one full salvo on target, and the subsequent 2.5s' slowdown are enough to land a second - or allow other carriers to land the majority of their aimed torpedoes, for that matter. This all hinges on whether you can get her to launch before the others get to, however, and that may require some tinkering with cooldowns.  
Formidable also happens to have a barrage if her Albacore tax is paid, but expect little from it unless she's in a mob fleet - the torpedoes are too spread apart from each other to ensure more than a couple of hits per spread, and that's not worth giving up the brutal damage output of a full aimed spread instead.
*About the Albacore...* it's terrible. Parallel torpedoes are bad enough as it is and this one doesn't even launch three, unlike the Barracuda; if you're taking one, it's strictly for the barrage.

* Desc: 
>Trades Unicorn's passive frontline Reload buff for a temporary Aviation buff and a significantly superior statline, HP pool aside.

  * [General Purpose] F6F Hellcat; SB2C Helldiver; Ryusei; Hydraulic Catapult; Hydraulic Catapult
  * [Poverty] F4U Corsair; SB2C Helldiver or JU87 Stuka; Tenzan; Hydraulic Catapult; Hydraulic Catapult

* Desc: 
>One of the best solo CV currently in the game, courtesy of her generally superior statline and a skill that can reliably lay the smackdown on waves and airwings alike - as well as provide some emergency damage absorption against incoming aircraft or shelling.  
It's not all bombs and sunshine, though - while her proc rate is high, she is nevertheless very reliant on that proc to perform and her generalist Efficiencies tend to blunt her effectiveness somewhat.

  * Upon airstrike launch, 80% chance to scramble a 'B-25' and drop 12 extra bombs.
  * 10s after battle start, launch a F6F fighter and if it is shot down, scramble that same 'B-25'; also, every 8s after launching the fighter, gain a stack of +3% Accuracy and +7% Damage up to a maximum of 5 stacks.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: Creepy Bomber Lady.
>The Essex-class continues to impress, this time with a new-and-improved Hornet that manages to completely obsolete her predecessor while upstaging Enterprise in terms of reliability and overall performance (despite not quite hitting the same damage spikes a x2 dmg proc allows her).  
The F6F-induced barrage won't see usage in PvE, but never fear - the stacking buffs will, and they'll be signficant.
On a side-note, that's a B-17's shadow and not a B-25's. Irritating.

- Desc: The Foxes launched first.
>Well, there they are, the poster vixens of Azur Lane. Distintctive in both looks and performance, they dwarf literally every other Carrier in the game with their massive amounts of Airpower and get to launch faster than anyone else, guaranteeing swift victories in PvP and one and a half extra airstrike per battle compared to almost any other carrier.  
As is customary for IJN sister ships, they truly shine when used together - but even when taken on their own, it cannot be understated how valuable that early launch (and extra screenclear) is.

  * When paired with Soryu, gain +35% Aviation.
  * At 10s and every 20s after that, launches a random amount of torpedo bombers that number from 5 (7%) to, 3(12%), 2(51%), 1(30%) dropping 2 parallel torps each.
  * Has a 3/2/3 loadout.

* Skill (Soryu): 
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants +15% damage output to the vanguard for 8s.
  * When paired with Hiryu, gain +35% Aviation.
  * At 10s and every 20s after that, launches a random amount of dive bombers that number from 5 (7%) to, 3(12%), 2(51%), 1(30%) dropping 3 bombs each.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: Ears of a rabbit, hearts of a lion, decks (and foreheads) of the gods.
>Once criminally underrated and now outshining even the Foxes in terms of raw damage, Hiryuu focuses on Torpedo Bombers and stubbornly refusing to roll over and die (by becoming invincible for 15s and launching an airstrike); not the most useful skill under the majority of circumstances, though her sister makes up for it with the always handy vanguard buff, but the real deal is the +35% Aviation buff that is further bolstered by the slew of extra stats the Kai brought, as well as the neat timed barrage (which is, despite its inconsistency, still free damage).  
Exceptional.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/ea/TaihouChibi.png "Taihou") - **[IJN Taihou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Taihou)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon completion of an airstrike cooldown, she has a 40% chance to launch a Saiun (increases own backline's Damage by 10% for 8s but deals no damage of its own), a 40% chance to launch a Suisei carpet bombing and a 40% chance to launch a Ryusei targeted torpedo strike.
  * Take -20% HE and Aviation damage.
  * Has a 2/3/3 loadout.

* Desc: Lady Luck is a bitch.
>Taihou is as fickle as she is horrifyingly powerful, equally suited to razing waves and demolishing single targets.
As the proud owner of not one, not two, but three whole separate plane 'barrges' and a bombardment-oriented plane loadout, she is guaranteed to set the oceans ablaze multiple times over, if given the chance(s) to do so - and even if said chances weren't forthcoming, her Heavy Armour, massive HP pool and defensive skill allow her to weather the storms until the next die can be cast.  
On a sidenote, she's also one of the carriers least affected by enemy AA boats due to the sheer volume of aircraft she can unleash. Nice.

  * If there are no other CV/L in the backline, grant +12% AA to it; upon launching an airstrike, launch a plane barrage whose pattern differs according to the number of CV/Ls in the fleet.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: USS, AUGmented.
>A very peculiar beast, this first USS sort-of-national-booster, but a very effective one nonetheless.  
While at first glance her skills may look like a schizophrenic mess, and to a certain extent they are, on closer inspection it's fairly easy to see what their intent is - boosting either dual battleship comps or full carrier ones as well as herself, in a remarkable display of versatility.  
You may have to rethink your fleet to accommodate her eccentricities, but she'll make sure it'll be worth it.

* Skill: 
  * Gains +15% Efficiency on a slot when using USS planes
  * Upon airstrike launch, scramble a TBF Avenger torpedo bomber; also, if sortied with at least 1 Cleveland-class CL, grant them +8% FP and gain +15% Accuracy/Aviation and launch 2 TBF Avengers instead.
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Very solid statline, extremely high efficiency planes and a plane barrage? That sounds too good to be true. Where's the catch?  
Well, beyond her being a CVL (ie. less planes, inferior statline compared to CVs), there really isn't one - beyond 'having' to take a Cleveland-class CL along to get the most of out of her 'barrage' (which is just one/two planes), which is a mutually beneficial relationship anyway, and having to mount US planes for similar reasons, which still ends up working in her favour.  
Tip - if you don't have the VT-8, resist the temptation to give her the regular TBF Avenger, as its cooldown is bad enough to make the usual Barracuda/Ryuusei still preferable, despite the Eff drop.

* Desc: 
>Also referred to as RNGer for obvious reasons, and infamous because of her potentially infinite damage, you need luck on your side to get the most out of her; even without the procs, though, very few carriers get close to the sheer damage output she can unleash thanks to her 8 sea-attacking planes and high Efficiencies, and none of them can manage it at her rock-bottom 9 Oil cost.  
Beware her near-total lack of anti-air presence, though; without Fighters or AA guns to speak of, there's little she can do about enemy planes.

  * Upon airstrike launch, grants +15% damage output to the vanguard for 8s.
  * Upon airstrike launch, 70% chance to deploy 3 aimed torps inflicting Ignition and Flooding from three planes.

* Desc: Puella Magi Toga Magica.
>Saratoga's Kai doesn't significantly change her playstyle: she's still the powerful DB-focused CV she's always been, but with a considerably improved statline that further emphasises her strengths. Extremely solid, even from a HP standpoint.  
Her Kai skill, just like her gunfire skill, is best regarded as a bit of free additional damage than a reliable contribution to the fight - the extra planes have aimed torpedoes and the DoTs they inflict are fairly weak, but it's still better than most CV do in their downtime.

Do NOT think she can solo backline past W6, though. Carriers aren't made for that and she's no exception.

>Once considered a liability due to the much reviled F/F/B loadout and an exp boost as a primary skill, Langley Kai's fortunes changed drastically with the advent of Air Superiority mechanics; not only do those fighters contribute almost or over twice the amount other types of planes do, but they're also extraordinarily cost-effective as well as slightly more readily available than usual.
If stacking AS is what you need but you'd rather not focus on carriers, look no further.

* Desc: 
>These two ships are identical in use (albeit not in popularity, only Saratoga has a Kai to this day), and specialize in clearing smaller enemy fleets due to their bomber focus and special salvo.  
They don't launch fast, but when they do they really leave a mark - make sure to stagger the launches as to not overwrite the Damage buff, though.

>A very defensive-focused CV with double fighter slots, a shield generator and staggering amounts of Air Superiority. Her low DPS is the stuff of legend.    
Her niche is providing air superiority and protecting the frontline from harm through her shields - helpful, and while they won't replace proper healer support, they WILL help with skills proccing on damage sustained (eg. Eldridge) and keeping vanguards light on HP (eg. DDs) running for longer, especially on torpedo strikes.

>The single toughest CV in the game, courtesy of her ludicrous HP pool (6.8k), the flat damage cut she extends to every KMS unit in the fleet (herself included) and the couple of 150% ME155s she can field to keep the skies clear; and as for the offence, she's no slouch either with her remarkable six 160% Efficiency Stukas.  
Her only real flaw is her lacking Reload, a mere 100 compared to most other top-of-the-line carriers - and, of course, her lack of synergy with non-KMS units, so keep her in there and she'll do work.

* Desc: 
>Chaser had a look at Ranger before leaving for the Royals and realised she was up to something good.  
With functionally 9 planes at her back and call without giving up her AA guns or high Reload, she can handily rival most other CVL in DPS while keeping some support capabilites to her credit - as well as a decent chance to throw out torrents of planes.  
That said, she's still mostly an attack craft - her ASW capabilties, while a nice touch, are entirely useless on non-ASW maps and unnecessary there, given how easily dealt with subs are.

    * The 1 NUKE deals 294 bdmg AND a 50% chance to inflict Flooding; the 3 BOMBS deal 248 bdmg; the 24 BOMBLETS deal 72 bdmg. Their damage is modified by 100% of the unit's Aviation and all have the same 100/100/100 mods.
  * Has a 0/0/6 loadout.

* Desc: Airstrikes on motorcycles!
>Hellbent on dealing surface damage and dealing it (relatively) quickly, Hermes Kai boasts staggering amounts of Reload that allow her to airstrike in just about 19s with high-efficiency BiS torpedo bombers - and little to no support capabilities, which mostly come in screenclear form.  
Her skills further semi-reliably let her stack her hand, either by dealing more damage on both her airstrike and the subsequent barrage or just by barraging and potentially cracking single hard targets or dispatching a cluster of adds.  
All things considered - pretty okay, and very cheap to boot.

* Desc: 
>The one and only carrier fully capable of defending herself, and actually contributing somewhat to the fight through her barrage.  
A remarkable claim to fame for her class, but somewhat let down by her poor efficiencies and poor offensive statline; fielding her in a KMS fleet is all but necessary to have her compete in battle effectiveness with light carriers.  
She *does* keep Tirpitz happy, though.

* Desc: 
>Despite her predictably awful statline - it's a collab ship, after all - Fumirul has some interesting tricks up her oversized sleeves that might, just might, justify taking her along.
First is her heal, which unlike most other heals can somewhat reliably affect the backline too, which in turn makes her quite valuable in BB-heavy environments where the flagship is often exposed to enemy fire; second is her FREAKIN' LAZOR BEAM, which is both badass and nasty, though hampered by its strictly linear nature.
Interesting and potentially useful, just don't expect to see her launch often.

## SS ![SS](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518517758602903554/563432311782113350/SS_img.png "Submarine Icon")
### A few preliminary notes

"Submarines" are powerful but specialized tools that behave rather differently from your ordinary fleets.
Here's a quick rundown of how they work.

1. You cannot control them directly; they will spawn in one of several fixed locations on every map and will stay there until you give them the command to relocate elsewhere (which costs a tiny amount of oil, roughly 1 + sub amount + tiles to move).
2. Submarine fleets move 2 tiles per turn, ignoring geography, and shave off up to 20% max HP (more with submarine-boosting meowfficers) off of ALL enemies in the node, and may also be summoned in battle if your regular fleets are fighting within said range. Map strike damage depends on the sub fleet's overall Power Rating, in-battle damage depends on the usual mechanics.
3. Submarine fleets in battle act as a sort of tactical nuke button; when summoned they will join the fight in person and unleash inordinate amounts of torpedoes via barrages to brutalize everything unfortunate enough to be on screen at the time, then stay for roughly 20s (exact amount depends on their Oxygen stat, with 10 Oxy equaling 1s) firing their 'regular' torpedoes until they run out of O2 and have to surface.
4. Unless in possession of skills saying otherwise, every sub carries 2 Ammo with her; this ammo is expended for Map Strikes and Call-Ins, and unlike normal fleets, once they're out of ammo they're completely out of the fight.
5. Submarine statlines are generally very similar to one another, barring a few exceptions; as it is with BBs and BCs, skills are the main discriminant here.
6. Gear is very important in order to have them perform. Do your damn SOS missions, fellas.

Given these premises, it quickly becomes apparent that **submarine fleets are meant to be fielded as a trio**; whether it be mauling nodes on the map or providing heavy torpedo support, they only reach peak efficiency as a full fleet, and in the case of map strikes such efficiency comes at no oil cost whatsoever.
As such, this section *does not contain tiers* but specific recommendations and groupings - let's get to them.

* Desc: Achtung - U-Boot!
>Given real world Germany's history with submarines, it comes as no surprise that the Ironblood gets the apex specimens of their class.  
Highly synergistic, they all benefit from hanging out with each other but are frail and somewhat lacking in support options otherwise - murdering stuff in call-ins is what they do best and that's all they do, but they better not take casualties.  
*About U-47...* while you may be tempted to use her solo, don't. There's little to gain from it and much to lose.  
*About U-81...* she torpedoes harder and gains more than the others from having fellow countrychildren around.  
*About U-101...* being able to close the distance with the enemy drastically lowers the chance to physically miss the target, but it is also somewhat suicidal if she's not equipped with a Snorkel. What's that? Not in EN? How unfortunate.  
*About U-522...* the call-in from across the map is a bit of a meme since you can move your fleet around anyway, but the extra O2 is just enough to let her skip Snorkels in favour of another Oxytorp.  
*About U-556...* yes, having someone reach critical HP is a terrible condition, and now she's not the only option for a full KMS fleet anymore she's the worst sub in the game. Sorry.  
*About all of them...* their barrages are semi-homing, just like regular acoustic torps. Have fun.

* Skill (I-19): 
  * 8s after joining the battle, launches a wave of penetrating torpedoes (up to 2 pierces, similarly to AP shells).
  * I-19's torpedoes lose 1 Speed and deal +12% Damage.
  
* Skill (I-56): 
  * If the Airspace Control status isn't Air Denial or Air Incapability, gain +15% FP/Torp/Reload.
  * I-56's torpedoes lose 1 Speed and deal +12% Damage.
  
* Skill (I-168): 
  * Deal +20% Damage to CV; also, launch a special torpedo barrage with 100% CritRate upon surfacing.
  * I-168's torpedoes lose 1 Speed and deal +12% Damage.
  
* Desc: Large and Discharge.
>Much larger and better supplied than their KMS counterparts, this line of IJN attack submarines trade synergy for heavy duty torpedoes, torpedo barrages and somewhat thicker hulls.  
About I-56... notice how it only says "AC Denial/Incapability"? Yes, this does mean she still procs in EN, where there is no Airspace Control at all.
About all of them... don't mind the slower torpedoes, it's actually a benefit rather than a detriment! Fast torpedoes may well zip past the intended target if it moved, but slow ones have a good chance to strike that target on the way back.

* Skill (Albacore):

  * Launches a special torpedo barrage with 70% Ignition chance upon surfacing.

* Skill (Cavalla): 
  * Lower the damage taken by subs by -15%; also, upon leaving the fight, heals 8% of her max HP.
  * Deal +20% damage to CV; also, fires a torpedo barrage when surfacing whose damage increases by 15% if sortied with Albacore.

* Skill (Dace): 
  * Deal +15% Damage to CA.
  * Gain +40 Oxygen.

  * Gain +40 Oxygen.
  
* Skill (I-58): 
  * Deal +15% Damage to CA; also, launches a special toepedo barrage upon surfacing.

* Desc: O2 Jamming.
>A rather diverse bunch of girls, these ones, but they all share a trait - their Oxygen tanks are ample enough to accommodate for two full Mark 16 torpedo volleys, which means they can safely be ran with dual Oxygen Torpedoes.  
*About I-58...* she is a solid starter, as she gets a special barrage to go along the extra O2.

#### ![SS](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e8/SurcoufChibi.png "Surcouf") - [FFNF Surcouf](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Surcouf)
* Skill: 
  * Upon joining the battle, grant +20% Accuracy to the vanguard.
  * Upon surfacing, fire her barrage and stay on the field for 12s longer.
  * Mounts a unique CA gun instead of the regular DD guns. It's good.

* Desc: On v ya!
>Surcouf is unique among subs for several reasons, not least of which her ability to stand her ground while surfaced.
Firstly, her guns are not only actually useful but also threatening; secondly, she bolsters the vanguard's fighting prowess with a hefty Accuracy buff; thirdly, she stays on the field for longer than anyone else while making full use of her entire armament throughout it all.
Her one downside is a subpar hunting range, but she's not meant to stay front and centre anyway.

* Skill: 
  * Upon joining the battle, launch a unarmed Saiun and grant +10% Damage to the backline.
  * Gain +40 Oxygen.
  * Mounts a pair of Seaplanes instead of the regular DD guns. Still better than DD guns, and actually good if said seaplanes are Seiran.

* Desc: Say What? to Blue Alien.
>Ah yes, submarine carriers - yet another of those wacky and not really effective IJN designs which to this day garner popularity, if only because of how unhinged they were.  
I-13 is the first of her class to reach Azur Lane, and despite the very mixed historical results, she puts on an impressive showing here - the damage buff is extremely welcome, the extra Oxygen nixes the need for a snorkel, her hunting range is comfortably wide and her Seiran can make a real contribution to the fight.  
On the flipside, her barrage is extremely linear and runs the very real risk of being entirely wasted if sortied as a sideliner.

* Skill: 
  * Upon joining the battle, launch a Type 0 Seaplane armed with a single bomb and grant +10% Accuracy to all subs in the fleet.
  * Upon surfacing, launch a torpedo barrage; also, her gunfire and barrage torpedoes have a 70% chance to lower the Reload/Acc of the enemies struck by 10%.

* Desc:
>A heavy-duty support submarine, I-25 forgoes the damage boosts many others have in favour of buffs and debuffs.  
While you shouldn't expect anything much out of the seaplane bomb, the +Acc buff is both permanent and rather substantial; the debuff, less so, but it is still welcome.

### A few notes, and Vestal

"Repair Ship" is a misnomer for these crafts, to say the least. Here are the reasons why ---> https://pastebin.com/RucY4TwC  
TLDR; they contribute little to nothing to the fight, their healing is pathetic and vastly outclassed as soon as you use more than a single DD for your vanguard, the +1 ammo is easily negated by a single ambush (and given the inability to attack surface targets they can't assist the fleet in the battle either) and they cost the same as the much superior healer options (Unicorn / Shouhou / Arizona).  
However, **Vestal** - unlike Akashi - has a few redeeming features that make her worth taking along for lategame low(ish)-cost farming, provided you don't mind the increase in clearing times.

#### ![AR](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/3c/VestalChibi.png "USS Vestal") - [USS Vestal](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Vestal)
* Skill: 
  * Once per battle, Vestal heals a ship under 20% HP by 20% of the healed's HP; if the target is Enterprise, the healing amount is increased by 50%.
  * Begin each Sortie with 3 Emergency Repairs (consumable +10% fleetwide HP heals, used in the map screen). 
 
* Desc: "Vestal is Bestal".  
>"Wait, Vestal? Why not Akashi? Isn't her heal better?", you may be asking yourself - and you'd be right, Akashi's healing capacity is technically better. And it doesn't matter in the slightest.  
As covered above, Repair Ships are *terrible* healers and far outshone by cheaper/stronger/both options; competing with them is a lost cause.  
What you seek in a Repair Ship is utility, and Vestal brings a surprising amount of it to the table: be it through her rescue skill, guaranteed to save an ailing backliner's sorry arse, her stellar AA suite (two AA gun slots, each benefiting from the ARs' inbuilt +1 AGM, and three auxiliary slots you can fill with AA radars to kick her plane offence into high gear), and the usual 3 fleetwide consumable heals.  
She won't clear quick and she's obviously more suited to high-AA environments, but she *will* get the job done.
