# Your Waifu is SHIP's opinionated & extra-biased JP tier guide (based on Kopfjäger's work)

## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
Azur Lane is a special little gem of a game. In a mobile market saturated by predatory, thinly disguised gambling simulators posing as RPGs, where the only valid choice is the rarest, most expensive, most lootboxable one, Azur Lane bucks the trend by having ALL of its units entirely viable for all content, given proper gear and care.

That said, however... to quote a wise Azur Lane Community member, "just because it works, it doesn't mean it's good": while all units are indeed viable, there are clearly objectively superior ones, and this Tier Guide aims to identify who are they and for what reasons.
Indeed, you could even interpret the tiers as a relative measure of how much investment is needed to get these units to perform, if you wish - a T0 would be a beast almost right out of the gate, whereas an untiered unit would require disproportionate amounts of effort - but I'd recommend treating the tiers as they're meant to be, according to the criteria below.

Whatever the case and however you choose to read this guide, I want to stress this - ALL units are viable, SOME are better than others, NONE of them will work if you don't know how to use them.
Good reading, and godspeed cap'n!
## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
 
  
  
### Evaluation Criteria:
- Ships are tiered by their PvE PERFORMANCE first and foremost, but notes on notable PvP usage will be made if suitable.
- Ships are tiered according to their ability to act as a STAND-ALONE unit.
- Ships unable to fulfil the above criterion (eg. carriers as a whole, Vestal) are rated according to their ability to act as a SUPPORT unit; buffs/debuffs/aa/heals garner higher ranks than sheer damage output, especially during boss fights. See assorted notes for reasoning.
- Ships are compared to others in their OWN CLASS for tiering purposes; if two ships are have comparable stats and purpose, the least expensive one will be ranked higher.
- Ships in a tier are listed alphabetically and in order of nationality (USS -> HMS -> IJN -> KMS).
- All units are assumed to be MAXED (ie. lv100, BiS gear, SL10 across the board).
- Auto or Manual performance is not taken into consideration, unless it is specifically relevant to the unit.
- Submarines will NOT be tiered until more data on their live, peak performance is collected. This will take a while, folks.
- The Retrofit Priority List orderings are decided on the basis of how effective is the retrofitted unit, not how much does it need the retrofit; in other words, the better (more powerful/more useful) the retrofit, the higher it is.
  
  
  
#### Tier Explanations:
- Tier 0                : The best of the best, rivaled by few and matched by none. They set the bar for everyone else.
- Tier 0.5              : Terrifyingly effective units with little to no real competition in their class or function, usually by virtue of exceptionally strong skills and statlines.
- Tier 1                : Generally very effective units, albeit marred by some minor flaw that can be easily overlooked or fixed.
- Tier 1.5              : Niche, quirky or plain but solid, these units can perform their roles well but will need to be handled with care.
- Tier 2                : Very niche and/or flawed but still noteworthy, these units can nevertheless do you good but will require serious work to get them to.
- Not Tiered            : Ships that range from 'usable' to 'bottom of the barrel', but in both cases not good enough to make it on the list.
- Pro Team Players      : Ships that, while unremarkable on their own, become exceedingly good when deployed with each other. They are tiered as a single unit.
- Honourable Mentions   : Ships that, while too weak or unwieldy for general usage, nonetheless possess some interesting or useful quirk that may warrant attention.
  
  
  
#### Retrofit/Kai Priority List:
- DD                  : Laffey > Ayanami = Z23 > Cassin/Downes > Kagerou = Tanikaze > Nicholas > Javelin > Foxhound
- CL                  : San Diego* > Jintsuu > Leander > Ping Hai/Ning Hai > Abukuma > Ajax/Achilles
- CA                  : Mogami > Portland > Furutaka/Kako > Suffolk
- BB/C                : Hyuuga > Ise > Yamashiro/Fusou (DO NOT TAKE LAST TWO NODES) > F* > Nevada/Oklahoma
- CV/L                : Ranger = Shouhou > Hiryu/Soryu > Saratoga > Langley
  
  
  
#### Assorted notes:
- Read the VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE at the top.
- The 'loadout' listed under CV/L entries details the number of planes each unit gets; eg. Unicorn gets 3 Fighters / 0 Dive Bombers / 3 Torpedo Bombers.
- The asterisk next to a name in the Priority List means the Kai is tied to some sort of event and may not be available right now; also, if you do not see a name in it, it's because it is not worth prioritizing.
- If you're wondering why carriers are judged differently from the rest, consider the following - they have no self-defence capabilities against suicide boats and are inherently worse than big guns at handling hard targets due to ordnance scatter and unhelpful anti-Heavy modifiers, but their AoE damage dispatches waves better than big guns usually do and come stock with screen clears.
- This guide is far from a solo effort: while the writing is mine, the tierings are researched and approved collegially with Gurosebe#4054, Enbayft#2527, Cantarella#7963 and the #helpful fellows over at the Azur Lane English Community server, while the coding framework that makes this possible was provided by Enbayft#2527 and improved upon by Boz#5174.  
Without these people, the Tier Guide would never be as comprehensive, accurate or good-looking as it is, and it is to them that I extend my sincere gratitude.

## DD ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/thumb/f/f6/DD_img.png/45px-DD_img.png "DD Icon")
### Tier 0:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b8/LaffeyKaiChibi.png "Laffey Kai") - **[USS Laffey Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Laffey#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% activation upon firing, increases own FP, Reload, and Evasion by 40% for 8s.
  * Every 20 seconds, has a 70% chance to active Vanquish Mode, increasing own Reload stat by 200% for 10 seconds and releasing a powerful barrage.
  
- Desc: "Vorpal Bunny".
>While pretty good to begin with, once Kai'd Laffey truly stands out thanks to CL-tier Firepower and Efficiency coupled with absurd amounts of Reload, allowing her to akimbo gun down any fool standing in her way. Her torpedoes also come out much quicker than anyone else's, but given the lacking nature of US torps spamming them is one of the few ways to keep them relevant.  
The DPS monster to AyaKai's DPH.


![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b4/YukikazeChibi.png "Yukikaze") - **[IJN Yukikaze](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yukikaze)**
* Skill:
  * While alive in fleet, the backline takes -8% dmg and, once per battle, heals any backliner under 20% HP for 10% of the healed unit's max HP.
  * 25% chance to activate when taking damage, decreases said damage to 1. 
  * Her regular barrage includes 4 conventional torpedoes.

* Desc: "She protecc, she attacc, but most importantly, she tsun catt".
>Nowhere as devastating as her tier companions (or a good few other IJN DDs for that matter), she is nonetheless quite powerful and has incredible defensive skills for both herself and the backline. Also, her barrage gets a few torps thrown into it for good measure.


![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/47/Z23KaiChibi.png "Z23 Kai") - **[KMS Z23 Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z23#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Firepower by 60% for 8s
  * Every 20 seconds, has a 40% (70%) chance to active Destruction Mode, releasing a powerful barrage and spawning 2 rotating shields that can block 5 enemy shells each, and for 10 seconds own main gun critical rate becomes 100%.
  * Can equip CL guns, but shouldn't.

* Desc: "Gun Fuhrer".
>Z23 takes the opposite approach to Ayanami, in that she goes all in on guns - her base FP is unmatched among DDs and her skills further ehnance her gun DPS to obscene degrees, while also having great uptime.  
Torps are even more of an afterthought than they are on Laffey, however, and unlike Laffey she can't make up for it by simply spamming them; she will punch ship-sized holes in Light and Medium Armour, but she'll find herself a little stumped against Heavy.


![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/2b/Z46Chibi.png "Z46") - **[KMS Z46](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z46)**
* Skill:
  * Whenever enemy planes are shot down within own AA range, increase FP by 15% of own total AA stat (Only base stat and gear is counted) and if skill procs again during its duration, it refreshes the buff
  * Increases AP damage by 25% (affects her barrage as well)
  * Her regular barrage includes 4 magnetic torpedoes.
  
* Desc: "KMSan Diego".
>The last word in terms of DD AA and well capable of going toe-to-toe with most CL on their own field of expertise, while being vastly superior in terms of damage output, survivability, ASW prowess and - most importantly - barrage quality.  
Proud owner of a quick-firing, high-volume, AP conal barrage with four homing torpedoes to the side that is boosted both by her own +APdmg skill (do not take AP DD guns unless you hate her) and her high torp stat, she puts every other standard DD barrage in the game to shame and is the main reason for her astounding effectiveness; the AA proficiency is a nice cherry on top, but not her main draw.

### Tier 0.5:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/8b/AyanamiKaiChibi.png "Ayanami Kai") - **[IJN Ayanami Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ayanami#Retrofit)** **(T0 vs Bosses)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Torpedo by 60% for 8s
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost Evasion stat by 30% for 5s

* Desc: "Nuclear Launch Detected".
>Ayanami is the last word in Torp Damage - with her skill procced, the damage she can inflict with them is completely unrivaled and, with enough buff stacking, can even exceed the tens of thousands.  
On the flip side, Torpedoes are all she's got and once she's blown her load, she won't have much to do except waiting for them to come back online. The DPH monster to LafKai's DPS.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/49/KawakazeChibi.png "Kawakaze") - **[IJN Kawakaze](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kawakaze)**
* Skill:
  * All IJN DD deal +15% damage to CL/CA.
  * Her torpedoes always deal 115% damage against all targets, regardless of the normal torpedo modifiers (80/100/130)

* Desc: Black Not Shooter.
>A veritable turncoat of a DD, Kawakaze's main purpose is making Light Armoured units' lives hell by drilling right through it with her torps and her stellar torpedo-armed barrage - and she accomplishes it beautifully.  
Terrifyingly effective against her intended targets, to the point of overtaking even Ayanami Kai - but she does still lose to her when faced with Heavy Armour, against which her skill puts her at a disadvantage.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c3/YuudachiChibi.png "Yuudachi") - **[Poi (IJN Yuudachi)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yuudachi)**
* Skill:
  * 6% chance on Main Gun fire for +40% FP/Torp/Evasion/Reload to self.

* Desc: 
>Outclassed by 3/4 Starter Kai, but still very valid. Her superior statline, her Laffey-like generalist buff that pretty much boosts EVERYTHING worth boosting on a DD and an excellent barrage let her crank out a lot of DPS even when her torps are offline.  
The general strat is to gear her with a super-fast DD gun to proc her skill+barrage as often as possible.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/8e/KagerouChibi.png "Kagerou") - **[IJN Kagerou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kagerou#Default)**
* Skill:
  * 15% boost of torpedo stat to the frontline
  * 30% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch
  * 25% e/ 20s, lower an enemy's Reload and Damage for 10s (targets humanoid ships first; debuff strength unknown).

* Desc: 
>Widely available early on and blessed with both excellent skills and a very solid statline, Kagerou has a place in every torp-heavy frontline (torp-CA in particular, as they typically do not have access to torpedo buffs). Her Kai is more of a slight upgrade than a massive change, with her skill being middling at best, but the extra stats are appreciated nonetheless.


### Tier 1: 
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/fd/CassinKaiChibi.png "Cassin Kai") ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/28/DownesKaiChibi.png "Downes Kai")- **[USS Cassin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Cassin#Retrofit)** **[USS Downes Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Downes#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * When HP falls under 20%, heals 25% of max HP once per battle
  * 60% chance to activate every 20 seconds, increase own Reload by 40% for 10 seconds

- Desc: "The bubblewrap fights back!"
>Packing a lot of Firepower for destroyers and blessed with a decent Reload buff to go along the excellent self-heal, Cassin and Downes may not have the monstrous damage output of their IJN counterparts but they can and will outlast them many times over.  
As it is for Phoenix, they are best used in mobbing fleets.


![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/3c/NicholasKaiChibi.png "Nicholas Kai") - **[USS Nicholas Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nicholas#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance upon firing to +40% her own Evasion and -40% damage received from planes for 8s
  * 60% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower for 8s
  * 70% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower/Torpedo/Reload for 10s and, once per battle, if an escort ship's Health falls below 20%, decrease the damage it takes by 15%. If the ship is Helena, additionally heal 8% of Helena's max Health

- Desc: "Sleepy Loli do it Better"
>Nicholas is a rarity among destroyers, in that she boasts both enough Firepower to face off with the best in her class and very solid defensive capabilities; a true generalist, even more so than Laffey considering her actually good torpedoes.  
With no real weakness on display, beyond simply not being quite as good as more specialised units, Nicholas is a worthy addition in pretty much any escort fleet - especially one with Helena or Fletcher.


![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/63/ShiranuiKaiChibi.png "Shiranui Kai") - **[IJN Shiranui Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shiranui#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 30% chance upon torpedo launch to launch a second spread
  * When alive in fleet, allied CV/L take -15% damage

- Desc:
>Ah, the wonders of Kai. Shiranui goes from an excellent 0LB DD meme to a supremely legit pick for normal play, owing to her much improved torp stat and efficiency. The CV/L protection skill is nice to have, too.
 
### Tier 1.5:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/37/MauryChibi.png "USS Maury") - **[USS Maury](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Maury)**
* Skill:
  * 40% chance every 10s to raise evasion by 60% for 8s
  * Upon launching torpedoes, 30% chance to launch a second spread

* Desc: 
>Good double torpedoes and merely passable guns? On my USS DD? It's more likely than you think.  
Maury does things differently from many of her colleagues, but she does them well - despite not quite reaching the torp heights of the IJN or the gunnery of the KMS, she strikes a comfortable balance between the two factions and proves a reliable, independent addition to most fleets.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/f3/JavelinKaiChibi.png "Javelin Kai") - **[HMS Javelin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Javelin#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Evasion by 60% for 8s
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost torpedo stat by 30% for 5s

* Desc: 
>While her starter version is pretty much undeniably the worst out of the three, the Kai does her some justice. Still nowhere as powerful as Ayanami or Laffey, but the EX barrage helps to close the gap while her Evasion is and remains the absolute best in the game.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/6b/FubukiChibi.png "IJN Fubuki") - **[Bucky (IJN Fubuki)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fubuki)**
* Skill: In battle, increases evasion by 30% and torpedo stat by 10% of all Tokugata (herself, Ayanami, Akatsuki, Ikazuchi, Inazuma) destroyers in same fleet.

* Desc: 
>The best buddy Ayanami will ever have, and she's damn good on her own too owing to her very high Evasion and Torpedo stat.


![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/89/KuroshioChibi.png "Kuroshio") ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/cb/OyashioChibi.png "Oyashio")- **[IJN Kuroshio](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kuroshio)** **[IJN Oyashio](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Oyashio)**
* Skill:
  * 30% chance upon torpedo launch to launch a second spread
  * 60% e/ 20s to +40% her own Firepower for 8s

- Desc:
>Kagerou's sisters with practically identical stats and the same double-launch skill. The firepower skill is kinda irrelevant, but that's not what you're using them for anyway.


![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/eb/TanikazeKaiChibi.png "IJN Tanikaze Kai") - **[IJN Tanikaze Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Tanikaze#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * When only escort ship alive, increase own evasion by 10% and reduce damage taken from airstrike to self by 50%
  * When her torpedo hits an enemy, 17% chance to make said enemy take 40% more damage from all torpedoes for 8s.

* Desc:
>Tinykaze sacrifices almost every part of her statline for exceptionally powerful torpedoes and a torpedo-boosting debuff.  
Devastating if the stars align and the debuff procs on her first torp hit, but little more than a dead weight while she's stuck reloading. Handle with care.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/20/Z2Chibi.png "Z2") - **[KMS Z2](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z2)**
* Skill:
  * Deal +25% AP damage.
  * Every time the main gun is fired 10 times, gain +5% Reload and +20% Barrage damage. Can be stacked 4 times. 

* Desc: 
>Z2 takes the concept of 'barrage boat' very literally.  
Not entirely unlike a few other DDs, most of Z2's DPS comes straight from her barrage rather than anything else; unlike them, however, this is by design and both her skills reinforce that notion, meaning she's at her best when manually controlled and firing non-stop and on the backfoot when she's not.  
Limited in scope but potentially very good at her job, given enough books.


![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/55/Z25Chibi.png "Z25") - **[KMS Z25](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z25)**
* Skill:
  * 60% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40% for 10s
  * Reduces the damage taken by the Flagship by 25%; can equip CL guns.
  * Can equip CL guns (but shouldn't).

* Desc: 
>Best of the three ships with the Flagship Protection skill, not only does she have powerful guns and high HP for her class but she also synergises beautifully with her intended protégé, Graf Zeppelin - who can protect her in turn.  
That said, if you have no need for such a skill you should probably look for another ship.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/4b/Z35Chibi.png "Z35") - **[KMS Z35](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z35)**
* Skill:
  * 70% activation every 20s, increase firepower by 50% and Reload by 200% for 10s
  * Upon expiration, decrease reload by 100% for 3s.

- Desc: "Vorpal Häschen"
>Z35 takes a page from Laffey's book and kicks her guns into overdrive, putting them to similar effect (and wrekcing them in the process for a few seconds).  
Very similar in behaviour to her USS counterpart, but whereas she can run a one-bunny show thanks to her Kai statline and skills, Z35 needs Z1's presence to really compare; and while she won't be matching her anytime soon, she'll still be giving many other DDs a run for their money.


![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/53/Le_TriomphantChibi.png "Le Triomphant") - **[FFNF Le Triomphant](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Le_Triomphant)**
* Skill:
  * Each time the Main Gun damages an enemy, gain a +40% Reload stack up to a maximum of 4 stacks (can only gain one per second, stacks lost upon damaging a different target).
  * When sortied as the Lead Ship, +20% Main Gun Efficiency and -30% AA Gun Efficiency.
- Desc:
>A gun-focused DD blessed with a great statline where it counts the most and a remarkable to go along with it, Letri is rather unwieldy but pretty powerful, if allowed to stack up and lead the charge. Handle with care, and the guns of the revolution will never fall silent.  
Similarly to Laffey, her torps are awful but come out quick; consider patching up this weakness with an Oxygen Torpedo.


### Tier 2:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/36/Charles_AusburneChibi.png "Charles Ausburne") - **[USS Charles Ausburne](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Charles_Ausburne)** **(T1.5 w/ CA, T0.5 w/ Fletcher)** 
* Skill:
  * 4% activation upon firing, increases Fleet movement speed, and Escort evasion by 40% for 8s
  * 60% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40% for 10s.

* Desc: 
>Another slippery little bastard, obsessed with justice and GOING FAST.  
Her torps are fairly worthless, but her guns are decent and her skill is absolutely amazing - not only does she increase your whole frontline's survivability, she also fixes whatever movement issues you might have at hand. The best DD friend your CAs could ever have.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/8b/EldridgeChibi.png "USS Eldridge")- **[USS Eldridge](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Eldridge)**
* Skill:
  * Upon taking damage, 15% chance to make entire escort fleet to evade all attacks for 10s. DoT and Ramming damage still apply. CAN'T PROC BEFORE 20s HAVE PASSED (skill starts on cooldown).

* Desc: 
>Slippery little bastard, despite her CA-like movement speed. Her offensive stats are somewhat lacklustre, but she makes up for it with her skill - it might be RNG and her high Evasion works against it, but 10s of invulnerability is nothing to scoff at. Make sure to have her eat weak shots to minimise exposure to dange.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/33/FletcherChibi.png "USS Fletcher") - **[USS Fletcher](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fletcher)** **(T0.5 w/ Charles Ausburne and Nicholas)**
* Skill:
  * Increases Firepower and Evasion of all Fletcher-Class in fleet by 30%
  * Increases Firepower, Torpedo, and Reload of DDs in the fleet by 10%

* Desc: 
>Lynchpin of the Fletcher Trio, think of her as an USS Z1 with a greater focus on gunnery as opposed to torps, as befitting her nation's doctrine. Very solid and dependable, but obviously better with other Fletchers.
 
 ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/5a/ArdentKaiChibi.png "HMS Ardent Kai")- **[HMS Ardent Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ardent#Retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * When alive in fleet, allied CV/L take -15% damage.
  * 25% e/ 20s, lower an enemy's Reload and Damage for 10s (targets humanoid ships first; debuff strength unknown).
  * When alive in fleet, allied CV/L deal +15% damage.

* Desc: 
>Your carriers' new best friend. While her statline is typically HMS (ie. low HP, okay guns, good torps, high Evasion), it's hard to turn down those carrier buffs and, with some skillful play or healing support, she's capable enough of holding on her own.
 

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/88/ShigureChibi.png "IJN Shigure")- **[IJN Shigure](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shigure)**
* Skill: 
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Evasion by 60% for 8s

* Desc: 
>Think Javelin before her Kai, except not terrible. Excellent stats, good skill, pretty good to use overall.
 
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/eb/NiizukiChibi.png "IJN Niizuki")- **[IJN Niizuki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Niizuki)**
* Skill:
  * 25% chance every 20s, Increase entire fleet's Reload by 25% for 8s (does not stack with multiple instances of the same skill)
  * 25% chance on firing AA guns to boost AA by 40% and reduce Firepower by 20% for 3s. Has MGM+1.

* Desc: 
>An oddity among DDs and especially IJN ones, Niizuki focuses on AA and guns over torps - and does so with a decent measure of success, too.   
Despite her low FP and an AA skill actively hampering it, her MGM+1 and good Efficiency let her deal constant, solid damage regardless; she's no KMS or USS Gun-DD, but she puts up a good showing and still retains serviceable torps, as well as an unreliable but decent fleetwide buff.

>New-and-improved Niizukis, now with half the clothing and a better AA skill. While DDs aren't particularly great at AA, they do get Main Gun +1 and their skill actively encourages hunting those planes down. Solid even when planes aren't around, better when there are.

* Skill (Anshan): While in combat, Anshan-class (all PRAN) ships have increased Accuracy, Firepower by 25% and evasion by 10%
* Skill (Changchun): Increases Firepower, Reload and Accuracy by 12% for all North Union and Eastern Radiance (ROC, PRAN) ships in fleet.
* Skill (Fushun): Increase own main gun's critical rate by 20%.
* Skill (Taiyuan): While in combat with 6 ships in the fleet, increase own Firepower and Reload by 25%, and evasion by 10%.

- Description:
>This pack of cleverly disguised Gunboat CL possesses a staggering amount of Firepower and Reload for its class as well as somewhat higher HP, but it does so at the expense of their now almost worthless torpedoes.
Use Fushun if you don't want to pony up for a full fleet: her DPS won't be as stable as Taiyuan's, but she won't be far off and you'll be burning a lot less Oil.

>This group of HMS DD is mostly remarkable for their low Oil cost, high Evasion, and being the cheapest delivery vehicle in the game for mass smokescreens.  
Unusually for these sorts of teams, its members' statlines differ slightly: Crescent is shooty (high FP), Comet is torpy (high Torp), Cygnet is slippery (high Eva). Equip and wield them accordingly.

  * +25% own AA; every 20s, launches a special barrage (torrent of slightly homing stars behind her, 1/4 of the screen in width) 
  * Can equip DD guns, and should.
  
- Desc: "WATASHI WA NUMBA WAN!"
>They finally did it, the madmen. Not only they Kai'd Azur Lane's greatest meme, they even made her the hero she was always supposed to be - sporting one whole extra Main Gun Mount, some much needed markups in Firepower and Efficiency, a shiny new and dazzling (but ultimately not too powerful) barrage and EVEN MORE anti-air capabilities, neither the skies nor the seas present any challenge to the once most unwanted gold unit in the game.  
You'll still want to give her an Oxygen Torpedo or two, though - her torp stat remains abysmal, and even if it's not the torps you're taking her for there's no reason to let them rot. Besides, fireworks go great with a nice, starry night.

  * +15% damage to Sirens.
  
- Desc: "Insistent termaidology."
>Unlike Hood and Monarch's case, there is no real ambiguity here - Neptune does do Phoenix's job better, although at a considerably higher cost.  
Armed with an excellent AP barrage and a very powerful AP boosting passive, and protected by the largest HP pool in her class and a better version of Phoenix's self-rescue skill, Neptune is perfectly capable of carrying on the fight for much longer while simultaneously making it much shorter than her USS counterpart could do.

- Desc: "The fox says 'torp'."
>As far as torpedoes are concerned, this is what peak efficiency looks like. Sporting three different superb torpedo buffs for whoever has any business mounting them and stellar torpedo stats+efficiency, she's a powerhouse in her own right with access to a handy damage cut (which she needs, considering her abysmal HP pool) and an uncharacteristically good barrage.  
With no real weakness to speak of, her one significant flaw is not being able to bolster CA torpedoes - you'll want to look elsewhere for that.

* Skill:
  * 60% chance every 20s, inflict a -40% damage resistance debuff on all enemies currently on the screen.

* Desc: 
>Helena is exceedingly good against bosses and merely alright everywhere else.  
While the power of her debuff is unparalled, it's hard to make sure she will proc when you need her to - either because the enemy has died already or there's no worthy targets on the screen, as tends to happen on mob nodes, or because it just won't proc due to bad luck; only boss fights tend to drag on for long enough to guarantee her debuff will proc and get some use.

>Sturdy, cost-effective and perfectly capable of carrying a fleet through multiple battles with no healing support, Phoenix is a supremely reliable workhorse for any fleet; whether it's farming or a cheeky way to skimp on healers to ramp up the backline damage, she'll get it done.

  * 25% chance on firing AA guns to boost AA by 40% and reduce Firepower by 20% for 3s

* Desc: "It's not luck, it's all skill".
>Lewdis' rather impressive statline goes exceedingly well with a solid set of self-buffs to all relevant stats for a Gun-CL like herself, letting her withstand amounts of punishment that would fell a lesser CL or fire harder and faster than much of her competition.

* Desc: 
>The cutest Belfast you'll ever see, and with a brand new support-focused skillset to boot.  
Not entirely as powerful as her older self, but she's up there without being forced to take a subpar gun, is considerably more Evasive and that full fleet healing is a nice addition.

* Skill:
  * +25% own AP damage.

- Desc: "Worth her weight in gold."
>Edinburgh is in a similar situation as Cleveland: both have merely 'okay' skills, both have impressive statlines, both will stay in front and tank for days while the rest of the team gets the job done.  
The difference lies in how 'safe' they play things, as Edinburgh gets a passive boost to AP damage inflicted, an even bulkier HP pool (4.1k is amazing for both varieties of Cruiser) and no AA skill to burn her FP, but doesn't get that lone shot at the fleetwide buff and may find herself short-changed when planes ARE an issue.  
Still, there's very few finer, more reliable frontline tanks than she - and that's a definite plus.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/31/LeanderKaiChibi.png "Leander Kai") - **[HMS Leander Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Leander)**
* Skill: 
  * +15% Firepower to CL/CA.
  * Upon battle start and on a 30% chance every 15s, creates a smokescreen (+40% Evasion Rate while inside) for 5s.

* Desc: A great statline, a discount price-tag, a Firepower buff for cruisers, a very annoying smokescreen for your PvP foes to deal with, and a smile to melt your heart. What's not to like?

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/cf/SiriusChibi.png "Sirius") - **[HMS Sirius](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Sirius)** **(T0 w/ carriers)**

  * Grant +10% Aviation and +10% HitRate vs DD/CL/CA to CV/Ls in the fleet; also, gain +7% Firepower/Torpedo/Reload for every CV/L in the fleet.
  * Gain +20% FP.
  * Can use DD guns, and should.
  
* Desc: Not 2B taken lightly.
>Similar in a few ways to Jintsuu, Sirius offers a spectacular buff to a specific subset of units while benefiting greatly from it herself - significant enough to offset her otherwise unimpressive statline and really get the most out of her DD guns.
Gunnery is her main asset, and her barrage even more so - one of the absolute best as far as vanguards are concerned, very quick and hard-hitting despite the unassuming Normal shells, and unique in its narrowing pattern, which makes landing most of the shots from long range a rather simple task.  
That said, you will need to deploy a few carriers to get the full experience and with her barrage making up a significant portion of her overall DPS, her auto performance will suffer - handle with care.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e7/SheffieldChibi.png "Sheffield") - **[HMS Sheffield](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Sheffield)**
* Skill:
  *  Allied ships with lower current HP than Sheffield at the start of battle have a 30% chance to take -50% dmg upon taking damage.
  * +12% CritRate and +30% CritDmg to self.

* Desc: Amazing how some spit and polish can enhance decimetres thick armour, isn't it?
>Rivaled by very few in the field of damage reduction buffs, Sheffield's defensive skill can greatly extend the survivability of almost any given vanguard, especially DD ones (provided she's placed in the middle and her HP has been raised above those she is meant to protect); and she'll do it while still being capable of packing a serious, if swingy, punch.

  * 25% upon firing AA guns, -20% own FP and +40% own AA for 3s.

- Desc: "The Original Dadster". 
>Units for whom the excellence of their statline outweighs a poor selection of skills are rare and far between, but there's few better examples than this than Cleveland.  
Sporting an impressive 3.8k HP, high Reload, slightly higher than usual Evasion and good guns, Cleve doesn't need skills to make her presence felt on the battlefield and excels as a tank; that said, while her AA skill is more of a detriment than a boon, her fleetwide boost is unreliable but potentially great.  
All in all, strong and dependable, just like her.

* Skill: 
  * 60% chance every 20s, +40% own Firepower for 10s.
  * Increases damage dealt to CAs by 25%

*  Desc: 
>Ajax and Achilles go all in on the offensive, sporting a stellar FP/Torp stat bolstered by high efficiencies and a decent skillset - despite the questionable usefulness of the anti-CA buff.  
Powerful for their class and rather inexpensive, but beware the severely subpar HP.


![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/84/BelfastChibi.png "Belfast") - **[HMS Belfast](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Belfast)**
* Skill:

  * 10s after battle starts and on a 20% chance every 20s aftewards, create a special smokescreen (+35% Evasion Rate and-35% damage from planes while inside) that lasts 10s.

* Desc: Hot maid, in more ways than one.
>Dealing more damage than usual with HE guns and packing better torps than every other HMS cruiser, she tends to have a good answer for most Light and Heavy Armour shaped issues - but not a great one on either side, and her smokescreen is almost entirely useless in PvE with its terrible procrate and planes not attacking you.  
Her place is strictly PvP, as there are many other CL who will do what she does - be it DPS or tanking - better for less.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/7/7a/AbukumaKaiChibi.png "Abukuma Kai") - **[IJN Abukuma Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Abukuma)**

* Desc: 
>Abukuma is the IJN's very own Leander, now with 30% more torpedoes: out go the FP buff and she smokescreen, in come the DD Torp buff and a decent chance to fire her rather excellent torpedo launchers twice.  
Not too flashy, but sturdy enough and dependable.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/37/SendaiKaiChibi.png "Sendai Kai") - **[IJN Sendai Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Sendai#retrofit)**
* Skill:

  * 10s after battle start and on a 40% chance every 20s afterwards, deploys a flare (-25% Evasion Rate in the area) for 10s.

* Desc: 
>A slightly weaker Jintsuu who stole a few notes from Aurora's book.   
Her statline is still damn good, though, and their buffs can stack - as do the -EvaRate debuffs, if you REALLY want to stick it to those DD in PvP.

A solid pick regardless, especially if you expect aircraft.

  * While alive, -20% Evasion Rate for enemy DD/CL.

*  Desc: 
>Excellent but niche DD/CL-busting skills paired with average CL stats, with the glaring exception of her sub-par HP.

  * While alive, CV/L in the fleet take -15% damage.

* Desc: 
>Agano is an interesting little beastie, proud owner of an unconventional kit (DD FP boost, CV/L defence boost) and... less proud owner of a somewhat unremarkable statline for IJN CL, especially when compared to Sendai and Jintsuu.  
While she isn't a bad unit on her own by any stretch, her competitors are more powerful and their skills more wieldy and impactful than hers - which means her best use would be as a DD FP buffer, similarly to London.

* Desc: 
>Leipzig is a solid buff-provider, but is put down by her own somewhat lacking stats. Best used in an all-KMS lineup for maximum impact, as well as Torp-CA fronts, but she has a place in any frontline.

  * If the vanguard is composed of Emile Bertin and DDs, +4 Speed and +20% Damage vs DD/CL for herself.

* Desc: 
>An ideal escort for French DDs, and not entirely without merit when deployed with other nations' destroyers.   
Her buffs are pretty decent, her barrage is good and her statline is alright, if somewhat low on the HP side; all in all, a solid entry in the CL roster.

  * Has MGM+1 and Torpedoes.

- Desc: "Союз нерушимый республик свободных~ ♪♫♬"
>The burden and glory of the true revolutionary is heavy indeed, and Avrora shows it through and through.  
Her buff is the absolute best in the entire game, no exception allowed; she gets MGM+1 while keeping her torps, a rarity only six other ships have access to; and her Armour is Medium, letting her outlast a good number of her competitors.  
As amazing as all this sounds, she is let down by one glaring flaw - her abysmal offensive statline, which even her impressive buff struggles to shore up, compounded with pre-WW1-era engines that grant her the questionable honour of being the slowest ship in the game (tied with Yat Sen).  
All that said, unlike Yat Sen she is certainly usable; okay-ish on her own and an amazing force multiplier, having her around won't cut into your DPS to the point of crippling your fleet and will help your other ships MvP.

- Description: The Great Wall of China.
>Obscenely slow (pre-Kai), pitiful HP and middling torps at best; Yat Sen is somewhat more interesting, with her double guns and twin AA mount, but her statline is severely lacking and has the questionable distinction of being tied with Avrora for slowest unit in the game.  
Nothing about these three looks usable, until you start deploying them together - at which point the sisters start evading better than basically anyone else in the game, even on the Single Line formation, achieveing unrivaled amounts of effective HP while dishing out respectable DPS besides.  
Lots of investment needed and Yat Sen MUST be protected at all costs (hint, place her between Ping and Ning), but they're the ultimate stonewall - if that's what you're looking for, it's worth it.

>Cursed to die over and over again in PvP due to her ludicrously powerful healing skill, which can on its own change the course of a fight, this poor girl has little to no place in PvE as you do NOT want your units to die there in the first place and her offensive power is lacklustre at best.  
Her one job is being immensely irritating/powerful in the arena, and dying for you. You monster.

* Skill: 
  * 15% chance upon firing AA guns, +50% AA to the entire fleet.

- Desc: "The undisputed, unwanted AA queen".
>San Diego has had, for the longest time, a terrible reputation - hailed as the prime example of rarity not being an indication of quality, her reputation is somewhat deserved, considering her main claim to glory is tons of AA (to the detriment of the rest of her offensive stats) when AA is only really needed in W12, a steep Oil price tag and a tendency to appear in crafting whenever you don't want her to... but that's not all there is to it.  
The usual claim is that San Diego can't do anything to surface enemies; if you were to use her as a normal CL this would be correct, as her FP is low and her Gun Efficiency is worse. However, her barrage can dish out surprising amounts of damage and she can mount DD guns, which means she can spam said powerful barrage; moreover, while her Torpedo stat is abysmal, her Torpedo Efficiency is good enough, meaning she can benefit a lot from auxiliary torpedoes.  
Does all this redeem her, then? Not really, even in this fashion, you'd need to manually control her and you'd need lots of high-end gear to get her to perform properly. If you're not expecting planes and you don't care about her, feel free to scrap her as you always did; if you do, then Sandy might just be what you need.

* Skill:
  * +15% Firepower and +30% Reload for 12s after killing an enemy vessel, if skill is already active it will refresh the duration 
  * When Minneapolis' HP falls under 30%, lose 2 Speed but gain -10% damage sustained and heal 4% HP every 3s for 16s (can only proc once per fight).

- Desc: Monster Hunter. Je suis monté.
> Upgunned, uparmoured, upskilled and, alas, upcosted. In most regards, Minneapolis is indeed a direct step-up from Phoenix: her CA guns massively overpower her predecessor's CL ones, the Medium Armour cuts incoming gunfire damage in half, the heal is somewhat slower but comes with a handy damage resistance buff... but it's the +FP/Rld buff when taking enemies down that's the real deal and kicks her DPS into really high gear, as long as there's targets for her to take down.

  * Take -20% AP damage.
  * Gain a stack of +8% Firepower for every 5 torpedoes launched by Mogami that hit a target. Max 3 stacks.
  * Has MGM+1 and torpedoes.

- Desc: Oni-chan~
> Step aside Portland, there's a new best CA in the game - at least on the offense.
While she is definitely less tanky, missing the extra 800 HP and 11 Evasion Port gets, she casts a massive shadow over her DPS thanks to higher Firepower, better Main Gun efficiency, better offensive skills, a much better barrage and, most importantly, still getting Main Gun +1 despite the torps as if she were a gunboat.

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/87/RoonChibi.png "Roon") - **[KMS Roon](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Roon)**

  * Every 30s, generates 4 orbiting shields (two on a very narrow orbit, one on a medium orbit, one on a wide orbit) lasting 8 shots or 15s.
  * +15% damage vs Sirens.
  * Has MGM+1 and torpedoes.

- Desc: ROON FOR YOUR LIVES!
> In many ways, Saint Louis and Roon stand at opposite ends.  
Whereas the former starts out strong and loses some of her lustre as the battle drags on, the latter only gets stronger; where the former's barrage is uncomfortably wide, the latter's is very concentrated and devastating; where the former relies on high speed and evasion to stay out of harm's way, the latter simply adds layers of HP and shields to power through the barrages; and as the former gradually mellows out of her cold templar persona, the latter grows ever more violent and unhinged.  
As a result, Roon is best served on boss battles - where she has time to rev up her guns and let the concentrated barrage tear single hard targets apart.

  * +15% damage vs Sirens.

- Desc: DESU VULT!
> Historically praised by multiple navies as one of the absolute best heavy cruiser designs but robbed of its chance to shine due to the fall of France in WW2, Azur Lane's Saint Louis has come to set the record straight - and does she ever.  
Mightiest of all CA by weight of stats and skills, there is no area where she doesn't excel - her guns absolutely melt opposing Light Armour and punch through Heavy Armour better than any other frontliners' in the game, her Speed is slightly superior to that of CLs and enjoys a hefty boost to her already high Evasion for more than half a minute after the battle starts, her AA is uncharacteristically high for her class and she enjoys all the perks of her Spe-CA peers (Medium Armour, MGM+1 and Torpedoes).  
The only fault one can find in her would be her barrage - its wide linear pattern helps dispatching multiple weak foes, yes, but also neuters its impact against single targets.

  * 25% chance every 20s, +15% damage resistance to the entire fleet for 8s

* Desc: 
>Exceptional HP, twice the base Evasion other CAs get, high Firepower and high AA - in a similar fashion to Cleveland, her stats alone justify her rating and the skills are just icing on the cake. She won't hit as often as Wichita or as hard as Chicago, but she's more consistent and much harder to kill.

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/7/7b/WichitaChibi.png "USS Wichita") - **[USS Wichita](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Wichita)**

  * 25% chance when firing main guns to fire another salvo

* Desc: 
>Can you say 24 shots in a row? She certainly can. Wichita is THE heaviest frontline DPS in the entire game, bar none. Her HP is rather lacklustre, but it's an easily solved issue and dead enemies can't hurt you anyway.

  * Upon Main Gun fire, 30% chance to double its damage

* Desc: 
>The pride and joy of the Takao-class, she's the only one who actually bothers buffing her sisters (as well as other cruisers) and gets that guns are better than torpedoes for heavy cruisers; as a result, she's a notch above her sisters and most Torp-CA.
 
 ### Tier 1:
---

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/7/78/ChicagoChibi.png "USS Chicago") - **[USS Chicago](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Chicago)**
* Skill: 
  * 30% chance upon Main Gun fire to double its shots' damage.

* Desc: 
>What was said about Wichita applies to Chicago as well. Slightly frailer than she is and needing RNG to get the most out of her, she will nonetheless punch hard - and harder than anyone else when she does proc.  
Also worth mentioning, if she procs on her first salvo, the buff affects the second one too!

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/58/HoustonChibi.png "USS Houston") - **[USS Houston](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Houston)**
* Skill: 
  * 20% chance upon Main Gun fire to gain +100% Eva for 15s.

- Desc: "Problem? What problem?"
> While an Evasion-focused CA sounds ludicrous, and it is under most circumstances, Houston actually makes it work given enough Evasion-boosting auxiliaries: CAs live and die by their Evasion (or lack thereof), so stacking it actually lets her survive under heavy fire for much longer than you'd expect.  
What issues she does have are fairly minor: she needs to proc to get tough, obviously, but her uptime is high and she has two chances to proc per firing cycle; and her damage output isn't as high as it could be, since her only skill is that Evasion buff, but it's still higher than most non-CA (and many Torp-CA) frontliners manage.

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/0/02/IbukiChibi.png "Ibui") - **[IJN Ibuki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ibuki)**
* Skill:
  * Gain +40% Torpedo CritRate and +65% Torpedo CritDmg (permanent).
  * Upon launching torpedoes, 30% chance to launch a special torpedo barrage.
  * +15% damage vs Sirens.
  * Has TWO preloaded torpedo spreads.

- Desc: What do you mean "she's not a DD"?
> Someone at the design bureau must've missed a memo when they designed Ibuki.  
Sporting an IJN DD's skillset and an IJN CA's statline, her entire being is at odds with her purpose as a dedicated torpedo delivery system. While she starts with TWO preloaded torp spreads and her said spreads can be exceedinhgly powerful, her torpedo stat is low and bolstering is hard, as she lacks access to the Sendai-class' buffs and OxyTorp auxiliaries come at the expense of survivability; at the same time, while her guns pack a respectable punch for a Torp-CA, they are completely neglected by her skillset and tend to fulfil the same purpose a DD's guns would (give her something to do while reloading).  
As a result, Ibuki's performance more closely resembles that of a high-end DD than a CA's - rush in, unload torps, sit down and wait to be useful again as torps reload - despite (mostly) enjoying the benefits of her CA statline.

  * Take -20% damage from DD/CL gun attacks.

* Desc: 
>Leader of the New Orleans class, she emphasises their strengths and shares their reinforced armour plating.  
Solid and dependable, if unremarkable. No reason not to take her if you're going to field them at all, but Minneapolis has better things to do than hang out with her sisters.

* Skill: 
  * 60% chance every 20s, gain +40% Firepower for 10s.
  * Take -20% damage from DD/CL gun attacks.

* Desc: 
>Sporting a matching set of Medium Armour, anti-DD/CL gunfire skills and considerable AA capabilities, the New Orleans-class CAs focus more on the defence than the offence, unlike almost every other CA in the USS.  
A good fit for mob- as well as boss-hunting, considering how frequent are DD and CL bosses, but beware their weaker guns and the need to take Astoria to make the most out of them.

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/bf/SuffolkKaiChibi.png "HMS Suffolk Kai") - **[HMS Suffolk Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Suffolk)** **(T1 when deployed with Queen Elizabeth)**

* Desc: 
>Boasting the highest Firepower stat out of all the non-event CAs and armed with a pair of skills further capitalising on such Firepower, she's a few notches above every other Torp-CA and has access to QE's buffs to boot.  
Just as frail as Wichita, though, and she's still a Torp-CA at heart.

  * Every torpedo launch has a 30.0% chance to launch another spread.

* Desc:

* Skill:
  * Each time Suzuya's Main Gun lands 8 hits (not consecutively, each shell counts as 1 hit), gain 1 stack of +5% Firepower and +25% Reload up to a maximum of 3 stacks; upon gaining max stacks, her barrage improves (gains two lines of 4 AP shots in a tight cone).
  * Take -20% AP damage.
  * Can take a CL gun, but shouldn't.

* Desc: 
>CAs aren't known for their barrages, but Suzuya isn't going to let that get her down.   
Blessed with one of the best vanguard barrages currently available once upgraded, and bolstered by buffs that naturally improve both her ability to barrage and the barrage itself, she's uniquely positioned to take advantage of an otherwise ignored feature of this class without sacrificing actual gunnery in the process.  
On the flipside, said barrage is also her *only* noteworthy feature - manual play is almost mandatory in order to play to her strength.   


![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/7/76/DeutschlandChibi.png "Deutschland") ![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/0/04/Admiral_Graf_SpeeChibi.png "Admiral Graf Spee") - **[KMS Deutschland](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Deutschland)** & **[KMS Admiral Graf Spee](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Admiral_Graf_Spee)**
* Skill: 
  * Deal +35% damage to DD/CL.
  * May equip the 283mm SKC28, but shouldn't.

- Desc: 
>Too large for mere CA and too small for proper BCs, these Pocket Battleships are odd creatures.  
Capable of mounting a unique underchambered BB gun, they sport massive amounts of Firepower, a wide and severely damaging barrage and a raging hatred for anyone smaller than they (DD and CL) - but are let down by that same gun's AP element (which underperforms against DD and CL), their lower-than-average Speed and Evasion, and the weak torpedoes they're stuck with.  
A wrecking ball against small craft, to be sure, but watch out for when they pick a fight with people her size - and place Spee at the front, as she is slightly tankier than her sister.

 
### Tier 2:

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e5/IndianapolisChibi.png "USS Indianapolis") - **[USS Indianapolis](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Indianapolis)**
* Skill: 
  * Every 30s, spawns 2 orbiting shields that last 8 shots or 15s; if broken, all nearby enemies take minor damage.
  * Upon taking damage, 8% chance to halve that damage.

* Desc: 
>The CA you'll use the most early on, thanks to her high staying power and her simply being a gunboat.  
Her poor damage output brings her down in the long run, though, and is usually dropped in favour of more powerful CA.

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/89/NorthamptonChibi.png "USS Northampton") - **[USS Northampton](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Northampton)**
* Skill: 
  * +15% FP to all CL/CA in the fleet.

* Desc: 
>What you use when you don't have Wichita but still want a powerful, buff-capable CA.  
She will be phased out eventually, alas, but she's good while she's there and you can still use her to augment a second fleet.

* Skill: 
  * +15% FP to the entire vanguard.

* Desc: 
>HMS CA get a bad reputation for being frail and either undergunned or undertorped, despite possessing rather valuable skills.   
London is one such example, but she rescues herself from the mediocrity of her statline by virtue of being one of the only two frontliners that can buff DD FP - a small niche, admittedly, but a useful one if you plan on fielding multiple DD with good guns.

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/33/AtagoChibi.png "IJN Atago") - **[IJN Atago](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Atago)**
* Skill: 
  * Increases HE Damage by 15%, HE burn chance by 12% and burn damage by 50%
  * 30% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch

* Desc: 
>Atago is hot as hell in more ways than one.  
The second most gun-focused of the Takao-class, she provides the most stable output and a decent amount of it as well - though nowhere near as much as a Gun-CA would, or even Takao for that matter.

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/84/MayaChibi.png "IJN Maya") - **[IJN Maya](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Maya)**
* Skill: Increases Reload by 35% and 30% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch

* Desc: 
>Maya trades Takao's double damage chance for a permanent passive reload boost. An interesting concept, and paired with double Autoloaders lets her fire her guns and torps faster than any other CA, which is remarkable on its own right... but is a rather poor trade nonetheless.
Also, she's slightly better at AA than her sisters (key word being "slightly", though).

![CA](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/0/02/Admiral_HipperChibi.png "KMS Admiral Hipper") - **[KMS Admiral Hipper](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Admiral_Hipper)**
* Skill: 
  * Every 30s, spawns 2 shields that last 15s and blocks 10 shots
  * 8% chance to reduce any damage taken by 50% on taking damage

- Desc: "HAAH?!"
>Damage control is about lowering the incoming damage as much as it is about preventing it in the first place, and Hipper learns the right lesson from Prinz Eugen - despite her much lower HP, Hipper's superior offensive statline and slightly improved tanking skills let her fulfil her role better and for cheaper.

>It's exceedingly rare for a frontliner to have more HP than carriers and battlecruisers, but Prinz Eugen makes it happen. Proud owner of a HP pool larger than 90% of the ships in the game, she pays for this priviledge by being saddled with a semi-useless skill and poor offensive stats.

* Skill: 
  * Every 20s, fires an aimed Normal slowing (-40% Speed for 6s) barrage (4 356mm quad-like shots) at the farthest available target.
  * Enemies hit by Duke of York's Main Gun fire take +12% damage from all sources for 8s; also, her first volley deals x1.5 damage.

- Desc: 
>With stats coming close to Warspite's stellar FP and Reload and a suite of skills aimed at softening the enemy up, not only she can lay on the hurt but she can also make sure her fellow warships do the same. A worthy inclusion in every fleet.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/a/ae/MonarchChibi.png "Monarch") - **[HMS Monarch](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Monarch)**
* Skill:
  * 70% chance on Main Gun fire, fire a fixed AP slowing (-40% Speed for 6s) barrage (Hood-like)
  * Once per battle and upon falling below 20% HP, restore 3% HP every 2s for 8s; also, for every 1% HP lost during the fight, her Reload increases by 1.

- Desc: 
>It'd be easy to regard Monarch as a straight upgrade to Hood. She mounts CL guns, Her FP is much higher, her Efficiencies are better, her barrage is AP and she can even heal herself... what more could one possibly want from a battleship?
The truth isn't quite so simple, though. While Monarch's statline is indeed superior (with the glaring exception of AA) and the self-heal greatly extends her operational time even beyond Hood's already impressive one, Monarch's barrage will neither quicken the backline's pace nor can it be used with the same reckless abandon due to the AP modifiers; while she won't fall flat against Light Armour, courtesy of her excellent regular shelling, she doesn't quite match Hood's supportive capabilities and weight of fire.
As a result, it would be wise to pick your sovereign of choice with an eye to battlefield conditions - if enemy BB/C are out for blood or Medium/Heavy Armour is getting you down, Monarch will weather their storm and put them in their place with staggering ease.

  * 70% chance on Main Gun fire, launches a frontal barrage (damage based on skill level), also if the fleet contains 4 or more Sakura Empire ships she gains -45% cooldown on first Main Gun volley.

- Desc: If you can't decide what to pick, pick it all.
>Packing offensive buffs for her enemies, defensive buffs for her backline, a barrage that includes normal arcing shells alongside linear AP shells and even aimed torpedoes, Amagi has quite literally a bit of everything in herself; and it all comes together as one sleek and effective whole, only marginally hampered by her IJN standard terrible AA.

* Skill: 
  * +30% Damage to self, as long as she is the only BB/BC in the fleet.
  * Every 15s, launches a cone of 4 homing torpedoes with improved tracking.

- Desc: "Slow and steady torps the race."
>One of the most consistent and hardest hitting BBs in the game, provided you cater to her social anxiety.  
Unlike many of her other similarly ranked competitors, Tirpitz isn't flashy in the slightest - no 'real' barrages to speak of, no gamechanging synergies, no ability to take other BB/BC with her - but she doesn't need to be, when hitting hard as a truck with no conditions or strings attached is something none of her rivals can claim.  
Tirpitz is, in a way, the "safe" choice - her abilities can't misfire, her HP+Armour make her tougher than anyone else, her damage buff extends to both her CL guns and torpedo spread, ensuring that even at 0 Ammo she will still be able to strike and defend herself at nigh-peak efficiency regardless.
However, all this becomes quickly irrelevant as soon as she loses her +30% damage buff as it the main reason behind her power; without it she has very little reason to be used and will be easily outshone by pretty much everyone.

  * Starts the battle with a preloaded volley, but has MGM-1.
  
- Desc: The terror of the Seven Seas.
>As befitting of a pirate queen, Jean Bart doesn't play by the rules: while lacking a third salvo would be a net loss on a dreadnought's effectiveness on the field, Jean makes up for it in spades by showing up to the fight with her horrifically overcharged guns already loaded, resulting in damage spikes that would make Ayanami blush.
Volume of fire is ultimately maintained by her gun, firing a respectable 8 shots in total, and cooldowns aren't a concern either thanks to her higher-than-normal Reload; whatever she's facing, it's heading straight to Davy Jones' locker.
Absolutely devastating, and unlike Tirpitz she has no compunctions about fellow dreadnoughts. The Jolliest Roger of them all.

>A well-rounded warship on her own right compared to her dakka-centric senpai, her set of buffs is about as good as those provided by Mikasa but she needs the flagship slot even more due to her barrage.
Place her there and she'll carry your IJN carrier division to glory and triumph; place her to the sides and she's merely okay.

  * +15% FP to the entire backline.

* Desc: 
>THE cost-effective BB in the game, bar none. No other battleship can boast a Firepower as high as hers, nor can they buff their colleagues' Firepower while they're at it - and Hyuuga does all this at the low, low price of 13 Oil.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/1/10/ArizonaChibi.png "USS Arizona") - **[USS Arizona](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Arizona)**
* Skill: 
  * 50% chance on Main Gun fire to heal the vanguard by 10% of their max HP.

- Desc: WAIT DON'T LEAVE JUST YET. 
>Healing on a cointoss sounds pretty bad, yes, but ask yourself this - how many units can properly heal at all, and how many of them pack the Firepower, sturdiness and self-defence capabilities of a BB?
>Yup, that's just her - and while her heal isn't as reliable as that of Unicorn or Shouhou, she's an excellent fit for a vanguard who doesn't strictly need the heals to stay alive and keep fighting.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/cd/North_CarolinaChibi.png "USS North Carolina") - **[USS North Carolina](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/North_Carolina)** **(T0 in Plane Hells)**
* Skill:
  * -15% incoming aviation damage to the backline as long as North Carolina is alive and in the fleet
  * Increase FP by 30% of her total AA stat (buffs not included)

- Desc: 
>Anti-air for backliners is a bit of a meme, but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one.  
North Carolina goes harder than anyone else on the AA front, as far as backliners are concerned - not only does she prevent plane damage with her skill, she also grows stronger the more AA she acquires (and she's plenty strong to begin with, sporting a very high base FP thanks to said skill).  
Whether you do actually need all that AA is another matter entirely, but rest assured that she will lay on the hurt even if you don't - and if you do, that's just gravy.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/95/WashingtonChibi.png "USS Washington") - **[USS Washington](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Washington)**
* Skill: 
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a strong barrage (mid-ranged conal machinegun sweep, long range focused bombardment)
  * When South Dakota's HP falls to/below 30%, South Dakota gains Protection (avoid lethal damage for 5s) while Washington deals +20% damage and absorbs 30% of the damage sustained by South Dakota.

- Desc: "Smile for the FCR!"
>An upgunned, uparmoured and upcosted Pennsylvania with some minor synergy.  
As expensive a price tag as 15 Oil is, Washington makes up for it with a slightly better statline (AA aside, which basically doubles) and an improved barrage with some mob-clearing power - as well as a defensive synergy with South Dakota, which sees more usage in PvP than it does in PvE as it hinges on Sodak risking destruction, something you should and most likely can avoid in the first place.

 ![BB](https://i.imgur.com/y3gjZTq.jpg "HMS Warspite") - **[HMS Warspite Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Warspite#retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * +10s after the start of the battle and every 15s afterwards, fires two aimed AP auto-critting shells at the farthest available target AND places a marker upon it (increasing the chances other HMS backliners will fire upon it); also, the first barrage will deal +130% damage.
  * Gain -5 Dispersion to the Main Gun, +15% FP and +15% HitRate against DD.
  * She may take 1 ASW plane as an auxiliary item. HISTORICAL REFERENCES HO!

- Desc: The Queen's Royal Corgi.
>Well, the Kai's come and gone, and Warspite's left in more or less the same position she once was - as far as PvE is concerned, at least.  
While her statline did enjoy a substantial offensive boost in the form of more stats, higher Efficiencies and a strong passive skill, her new-and-improved barrage suffers from the same unreliability that torpedoed her shot(s) at glory - as powerful as those AP shells now are, they're still all too likely to be fired at Light targets (or worse, at fireboats), while the marker part of barrage appears to be bafflingly ineffectual, as evidenced both by *HMS BB/C still opening fire on unmarked targets* and by the possibility of *multiple markers coexisting, negating the supposed benefits*.  
On the bright side, Warspite's newfound strength lets her be competitive there once more in the PvP areans, where her intended targets are always armoured, immobile and valuable.  
[Also, she's still a corgi.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/460645783021289472/516185017995624449/RoyalCorgi.png)

* Skill:
  * 50% chance on Main Gun fire to launch a special barrage (long range: tight 4-shot wave, tight 4-shot wave with 2 shots to the sides; short range: wide V-shaped spread of small bullets)
  * 10s after battle start and every 20s, afterwards, launches a torpedo barrage (2 lines of 2 aimed torps).

- Desc: A sidegrade to Washington.
>Sturdier, more powerful, better armed and in possession of a much more useful synergy (Akagi still gets her +35% Aviation buff with her) in PvE, BB Kaga - affectionately called "Baga" - does however forfeit some reliability on her enhanced barrage and is stuck with an atrocious AA stat.  
She also has a few torps to throw out every now and then, but they're fairly lacklustre.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e1/YamashiroChibi.png "IJN Yamashiro") ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/a/a8/FusouChibi.png "IJN Fusou") - **[IJN Yamashiro](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yamashiro)** **[IJN Fusou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fusou)** **(Kai)**
* Skill: 
  * +20% FP to self.
  * (Kai) On first airstrike, launch additional Zuiun.

* Desc: 
>The second most cost-effective BBs in the game, owing to their remarkable statline, Kai nodes and comparatively low Oil costs.  
Their Kai is unique in that it is a sidegrade rather than an upgrade: when turned into BBV, they trade their CL guns and 1/3 of their BB salvo for seaplanes, letting them launch airstrikes as if they were carriers.  
A steep price to pay, especially considering how weak the seaplanes are in comparison to 'proper' bombers, how slow the launches are in comparison to 'proper' carriers and how much better are Ise and Hyuuga as BBVs.

  * 8% chance to reduce any damage taken by 50% on taking damage
  * 30% chance to do double damage when firing main gun

* Desc: 
>Similar in form, statline and function to her bigger, blacker cousin - AA and backline-wide tank skill aside - these cowgirls operate at a fraction of Sodak's cost while providing similar results. Still RNG, yes, but still quite solid.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/80/South_DakotaChibi.png "USS South Dakota") - **[USS South Dakota](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/South_Dakota)**
* Skill: 
  * Every 30s, absorb 50% damage taken by main fleet for 8s, then heal for 50% of the damage taken during that time
  * 30% chance to do double damage when firing main gun

* Desc: 
>While her tanking skill isn't good enough to make her the tank she's meant to be, she is undeniably hard to kill thanks to her large HP pool and all-around excellent stats, AA included (a rarity among BB/Cs); her double damage proc needs RNG to work, but when it does it will annihilate whatever she aimed at.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/0/03/Queen_ElizabethChibi.png "HMS Queen Elizabeth")- **[HMS Queen Elizabeth](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Queen_Elizabeth)** **(T0 w/ FULL HMS fleet, the less HMS units the lower the tier)**
* Skill: 
  * +15% FP/Torp/AA/Evasion/Reload to all HMS ships.

* Desc: The core of most HMS fleets. 
> An unassuming figure and a merely okay statline belies one of the best buffs in the game - albeit faction-locked, and reliant on large fleets to make the most of it.  
You're not taking her because she's good, but because she's a force multiplier.
 
 ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/8a/KirishimaChibi.png "Kirishima") - **[IJN Kirishima](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kirishima)**
* Skill: 
  * 60% chance upon Main Gun fire, launch a semi-aimed Sanshikidan barrage (8 shells in two waves of four, heading towards the nearest enemies); also, deal +15% damage to BB.

* Desc: 
>(PvE) Airstrike murderer extraordinaire thanks to her barrage, accomplished fireboat slayer owing to her CL guns on a BC frame, and even gets an edge against the most threatening enemies you can face later on.
A very solid defensive pick, further helped by the fact her Sanshikidan barrage doesn't need her to be in the flagship slot to do work.
 
 ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/23/KongouChibi.png "Kongou") - **[IJN Kongou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kongou)**
* Skill: 
  * While alive in fleet, +15% Firepower/Accuracy and +20% Evasion for all Kongou-class (Kongou, Kirishima, Haruna, Hiei). 

* Desc: Kongou-class support craft. Not very flashy, but her buffs are anything but unremarkable - the extra Evasion in particular makes a Kongou-class backline powerful and extremely hard to shift.
 
![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c9/IseChibi.png "IJN Ise") - **[IJN Ise](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ise)**
* Skill: 
  * +20% FP to self.

* Desc: Quite literally an improved non-Kai Yamashiro/Fusou in all respects, from the statline to the efficiencies. Not much to say here.

![BC](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/52/GneisenauChibi.png "KMS Gneisenau") - **[KMS Gneisenau](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Gneisenau)** **(T1 if deployed with Graf Zeppelin)**
* Skill:
  * +25% FP to self.
  * 20s, launch 3 unguided torpedoes in a cone.

* Desc: 
>Think Tirpitz, except not quite as hard-hitting and not as fussy about her company. She will outdamage all her BC competitors (excepting Hood and Amagi), while still being able to defend herself through a set of CL guns.  
A force to be reckoned with, especially considering her cost, but don't count on the torps to do much more than stop the occasional fireboat.
 
![BC](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/89/ScharnhorstChibi.png "KMS Scharnhorst") - **[KMS Scharnhorst](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Scharnhorst)** **(T1 if deployed with Graf Zeppelin)**
* Skill:
  * Every 15s, fires a 3-bullet (Normal, upgrades to AP after SL6) auto-critting salvo at a random target.
  * Every 20s, launch 3 unguided torpedoes in a cone.

* Desc: 
>Think Warspite, except with a functional barrage and less showboating. Between her regular guns, the CL secondaries, the automated barrage and the torps, she will throw out damage more often than any other backliner in the game.  
A force to be reckoned with, just like her sister; and just like her sister, don't count on her torps at all.


### Tier 2:

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/59/CaliforniaChibi.png "USS California") - **[USS California](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/California)**
* Skill: 
  * 30% chance upon Main Gun fire, x2 damage to the entire volley.

* Desc: 
>By most intents and purposes, a discount South Dakota who gives up her bigger, blacker sister's AA capabilities, a portion of her statline and her shield for a lower Oil cost.   
Still hits damn hard, though, and harder still when she's on a good roll.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/61/PennsylvaniaChibi.png "USS Pennsylvania") - **[USS Pennsylvania](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Pennsylvania)**
* Skill: 
  * 20s 60% chance, fires a special barrage (4 salvo of 3 shots barraging bombarding the middle of the screen, Normal modifiers)

* Desc: 
>Often overlooked in favour of other barrage ships (eg. Hood, Washington), Pennsylvania plays it different from many others by having a timed proc instead of a main-gun-fire-based one.  
While this means you can equip whichever BB gun you'd like to stick on her, it also means that she may proc when you don't need her to and waste the barrage.  
A bit fiddly, but arguably more flexible than most and just as powerful.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/d4/Prince_of_WalesChibi.png "HMS Prince of Wales") - **[HMS Prince of Wales](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Prince_of_Wales)** **(T1.5 if deployed w/ USS fleet)**
* Skill: 
  * For every USS ship in the fleet, +5% to own FP/AA/Evasion/Reload.

* Desc: 
>Demands a specific fleet composition to outshine her competition, but is it sweet when she does - +25% FP, AA, Reload and Evasion are nothing to laugh at, but it cannot be understated how much she limits your composition.


![BC](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c1/RenownChibi.png "HMS Renown") - **[HMS Renown](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Renown)** **(T1.5 if deployed w/ Queen Elizabeth)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon first Main Gun fire, +15% Damage to all subsequent salvo (does not stack nor reset).

* Desc: 
>Lo and behold, owing to solid FP and Reload as well as a good skill the Saberface's damage output is pretty good. DD secondary guns however mean she won't really be able to defend herself properly.

![BC](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/1/12/IzumoChibi.png "Izumo") - **[IJN Izumo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Izumo)**
* Skill: 
  * 70% chance on Main Gun fire, launch a fixed linear AP barrage.
  * Take -35% AP damage, but take +6% Ignition damage and extends Ignition duration by 3s.
  * Deal +15% damage vs Sirens.

* Desc: Consistently bad.
>One really has to wonder what has Izumo ever done to developers to warrant such a treatment.
As awful in AL as she is in WoWS, Izumo is bad by any standard - her barrage barely scratches Light Armour while being unable to bypass it due to the parallel shots, her 'defensive' skill harms her much more than it does protect her due to the complete absence of enemy BB AP (and prevalence of BB HE), and worse still, as a barrage boat she needs flagship slot... while sharing Mikasa, Nagato and Kirishima's nation.
Her sole saving grace is her exceptional statline, and even then it is marred by high Oil costs, comparatively low Efficiencies and is far from making any significant difference.
Bad not just by PR standards but as a whole, there is little to no reason to ever use her over any other barrage boat.

![BC](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/3a/MikasaChibi.png "Mikasa") - **[IJN Mikasa](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Mikasa)** **(T0 if deployed w/ IJN BB/BC)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon taking damage, 12% chance to halve that damage; also, when sortied as Flagship, grant all IJN units +20% Firepower/Reload.
  * 60% chance upon Main Gun fire, grant all BB/C +20% damage output for 8s.
  * If equipping the "Z Flag" auxiliary item, grant +5% Firepower/Accuracy to the entire fleet.

* Desc: Pint-sized dai-senpai.
>While her HP might be low and she may lack an AA gun, she does make up for it in spades through a superb Reload stat and astoundingly good buffs.  
An iffy pick on her own, but a monstrous force multiplier for other IJN BB/Cs and no slouch herself.

![BC](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/96/MutsuChibi.png "Mutsu") - **[IJN Mutsu](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Mutsu)**
* Skill: 
  * 40% chance on Main Gun fire, launch a fixed linear HE barrage.

* Desc: 
>An oversized monitor like Rodney or Nelson, but with an actually good barrage and better stats.

![BC](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/81/DunkerqueChibi.png "Dunkerque") - **[MNF Dunkerque](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Dunkerque)**
* Skill: 
  * 50% chance on Main Gun fire, launch a fixed linear HE barrage (2 tight columns of 4 HE shells and a few needles to the sides).
  * Starts the battle with a preloaded volley, but has MGM-1.

* Desc: The predecessor to Jean Bart, and it does show.
>Like Jean, she lacks her third salvo and can launch her bombardment immediately; unlike Jean, said bombardment operates just like any other and is considerably weaker as a result, while her barrage fires on a coin toss.  
All that said, she'll always get to fire one more volley per round than 99% of the other dreadnoughts and her gun efficiency is very high.   Decent, all things considered.

* Skill: Every 20s, 60% chance to fire a special barrage.

- Desc: "The poor man's Barrage Boat."
>A description partly in jest, and partly absolutely accurate - compared to a normal BB, they are incredibly frail (barely 3k HP with Light Armour) and considerably weaker (low FP, slightly lower Efficiency, one less salvo per volley), but they also cost a fraction than what they do and still get truly impressive barrages.  
How does this come together? As pint-sized discount-costed powerhouses for early world farming, that's how: while low, their Firepower is enough to stop fireboats in their tracks, and if given enough Evasion, they can be reliably expected to evade incoming BB salvo, prolonging their operational time much beyond what their abysmal statline would lead you to believe.  
Monitors can be expected to auto their way up to W8 or 9 with little resistance. Any further, though, and auto becomes almost impossible as enemies get more accurate, tougher and more powerful: the moment a BB opens up on them, they're already dead.
 
#### ![BM](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/bc/NelsonChibi.png "HMS Nelson") ![BM](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/ca/RodneyChibi.png "HMS Erebus") - [HMS Nelson](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nelson) [HMS Rodney](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Rodney)
* Skill: 40% chance to fire a special barrage when firing main gun.

- Desc: "Newbie traps."
>So you just started playing and found these two BBs. Their barrages fire lasers everywhere and melt mobs and they look pretty tough, so they've gotta be good, right?  
Well, no, not really. It'll be like that only early on, where enemies tend to fall to a stiff breeze anyway, but the moment they're faced by serious opposition and normal (eg. 1.5k / 2k HP per trash mob) HP pools, the weaknesses of said barrage quickly come to the fore: low proc rate, proc fixed to main gun fire (which means having to take faster and weaker guns to fish for said procs), super-wide pattern subject to massive scatter and unable to hit what's directly in front of them, poor armour modifiers and poor base damage.  
In short, their barrage is the only notable feature they have - and it's both unreliable and weak.  
Avoid.

#### ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b3/ColoradoChibi.png "USS Colorado") ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c1/West_VirginiaChibi.png "USS West Virginia") ![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/a/a9/MarylandChibi.png "USS Maryland") - [USS Colorado](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Colorado) [USS West Virginia](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/West_Virginia) [USS Maryland](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Maryland)
* Skill: 
  * 40% chance to fire a special barrage when firing main gun
  * (Maryland) When her HP drops below 70% increase her damage dealt based on how low her HP is, up to +35%.

- Desc: "The pits."
>You know what was just said about Nelson and Rodney? Well, they're even worse, courtesy of their weaker statlines and lack of CL guns; as for Maryland's +Dmg on low HP, it goes without saying that if you're taking damage, you're in an undesirable situation to begin with.  
Outgunned, outskilled, outcosted. With no hyperbole, they ARE the worst BBs in the game.

* Skill: 
  * Grant +15% FP to the backline.
  * Gain +20% FP.
  * 10s after battle start, 10s cooldown after each use and used only when an enemy gets too close, fire 4 converging CA shells.
 
* Desc: 
>The only aviation battleship to improve in every possible respect after her Kai, the new-and-improved Hyuuga doesn't only sport the customary brutal firepower and enough Main Gun Efficiency to thorougly brutalize what she hits despite the loss of one gun mount, but also retains good self-defence capabilities with her protective barrage.   
The seaplanes are still middling at best, but you're paying no price for a BB with access to a screenclear - that's more than good enough.

* Skill: 
  * Gain +20% FP.
  * Ise Kai's first two airstrikes have their cooldown reduced by 25% and launch 2 Suisei dive bombers; if a CV/L is present in the fleet, these bonuses remain active.

* Desc: 
>Still the more powerful yet less useful sibling, Ise Kai fully embraces her nature as an instrument of destruction by improving her airstrikes to the point of respectability.
Damage's still not on par with proper carriers, sure, but it's leagues better than what other BBVs gets in terms of both damage and cooldown - and the only thing better than a screenclear is a screenclear that can take out some enemies alongside the bullets.

* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, launches a tight horizontal line of eight additional TBDs armed with parallel, Flooding-inflicting torps; also, deal +10% damage vs BBs.
  * Increases her own AA and Airpower by 5% for every USS CV/L in the fleet, and increases her own Airpower by 3% whenever her planes shoot down an enemy aircraft (to a maximum of +15% Airpower).
  * If the fleet contains 4 or more USS ships, the entire fleet has a 12% chance to reduce incoming aircraft torpedo and bomb damage to 1.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Boasting a statline rivaled only by that of Enterprise, graced by even more Efficient planes (especially her 140% Fighters), armed to the teeth with skills further boosting that statline, a squadron of DoT-inflicting torpedo bombers and a fleet-wide chance to outright negate incoming aircraft damage, she is meant to give even the Foxes (or W12's plane swarms) pause for thought - and manages to do so with gusto.  
What keeps her from true greatness is how strictly she enforces a specific compositon for your backline to make the most of her skills - US carriers only might not be a bad thing per se, but it severely limits your choices. Her second skill being susceptible to killsteals by allied carriers or AA, and her third skill being nigh-on useless in PvE, doesn't help matters either.  
All that said, when she's good, she's REALLY good.
 
 ![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/f7/CentaurChibi.png "Centaur") - **[HMS Centaur](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Centaur)**
* Skill:

  * Upon airstrike launch, grant +15% Aviation and +10% Firepower to the backline for 8s.
  * Has a 4/0/4 loadout.

* Desc: Centaur is the best generalist the game has to offer among its backliners.
>Aircraft got you down? Here's 4 Figthers, backed up by high Airpower and good efficiencies.  
Need to squeeze out some more damage? Her Swordfishes and 'conventional' torp bombers are pretty brutal.  
Backline could use some buffs or packing BBV? Whether it's carriers or battleships OR BOTH, she's got them (and herself) covered.  
Enemy ships are zipping around too much for your liking? Her Swordfishes inflict Slow and throw out two walls of crisscrossing torps, so they can have fun with that.  
Subs? Don't let her stats fool you, she's still a CVL and that means she can bomb them with impunity (and great effect at that).  
Whatever's getting you down, Centaur has the solution for it - and while she won't match the heights of more specalized units in their fields, her responses tend to be more than enough for most tasks at hand.

* Skill: 
  * 70% chance on airstrike launch, airstrike deals x2 damage and Enterprise becomes invincible for 8s.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>One of the best solo CV currently in the game, courtesy of her generally superior statline and a skill that can reliably lay the smackdown on waves and airwings alike - as well as provide some emergency damage absorption against incoming aircraft or shelling.  
It's not all bombs and sunshine, though - while her proc rate is high, she is nevertheless very reliant on that proc to perform and her generalist Efficiencies tend to blunt her effectiveness somewhat.
 
![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/48/Shangri-LaChibi.png "Shangri-la") - **[USS Shangri-La](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shangri-La)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, 80% chance to scramble a 'B-25' and drop 12 extra bombs.
  * 10s after battle start, launch a F6F fighter and if it is shot down, scramble that same 'B-25'; also, every 8s after launching the fighter, gain a stack of +3% Accuracy and +7% Damage up to a maximum of 5 stacks.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: Creepy Bomber Lady.
>The Essex-class continues to impress, this time with a new-and-improved Hornet that manages to completely obsolete her predecessor while upstaging Enterprise in terms of reliability and overall performance (despite not quite hitting the same damage spikes a x2 dmg proc allows her).  
The F6F-induced barrage won't see usage in PvE, but never fear - the stacking buffs will, and they'll be signficant.
On a side-note, that's a B-17's shadow and not a B-25's. Irritating.


 
 ![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e7/UnicornChibi.png "HMS Unicorn") - **[HMS Unicorn](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Unicorn)**
* Skill: 
  * On launching an airstrike, heals the escort fleet for 8% HP
  * Increases Reload of escort fleet by 15%
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Arguably the best support CVL in the game, between the heal, the reload buff and the fighter support she provides a lot of value simply by existing; and stopping her from existing is quite hard given her large HP pool, at least for the class.
 
![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/64/AkagiChibi.png "IJN Akagi") ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/dc/KagaChibi.png "IJN Kaga") - **[IJN Akagi](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akagi)** **[IJN Kaga](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kaga)** **(T0 when together)**
* Skill: 
  * First Airstrike launches 50% faster
  * When paired, increase Air Power by 35%
  * Have a 3/2/3 loadout.

- Desc: "The Foxes launched first."
>Well, there they are, the poster vixens of Azur Lane. Distintctive in both looks and performance, they dwarf literally every other Carrier in the game with their massive amounts of Airpower and get to launch faster than anyone else, guaranteeing swift victories in PvP and one and a half extra airstrike per battle (compared to other CVs).  
As is customary for IJN sister ships, they only shine when used together - but even when taken on their own, it cannot be understated how valuable that early launch is.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/ef/HiryuuKaiChibi.png "Hiryu Kai") ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e0/SouryuuKaiChibi.png "Souryuu Kai") - **[IJN Hiryu Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hiryuu#retrofit)**  **[IJN Soryu Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Souryuu#retrofit)**
* Skill (Hiryu): 
  * Once per battle and upon taking lethal damage, Hiryu becomes invincible for 15s and immediately launches a full airstrike.
  * When paired with Soryu, gain +35% Aviation.
  * At 10s and every 20s after that, launches a random amount of torpedo bombers that number from 5 (7%) to, 3(12%), 2(51%), 1(30%) dropping 2 parallel torps each.
  * Has a 3/2/3 loadout.

* Skill (Soryu): 
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants +15% damage output to the vanguard for 8s.
  * When paired with Hiryu, gain +35% Aviation.
  * At 10s and every 20s after that, launches a random amount of dive bombers that number from 5 (7%) to, 3(12%), 2(51%), 1(30%) dropping 3 bombs each.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: Ears of a rabbit, hearts of a lion, decks (and foreheads) of the gods.
>Once criminally underrated and now outshining even the Foxes in terms of raw damage, Hiryuu focuses on Torpedo Bombers and stubbornly refusing to roll over and die (by becoming invincible for 15s and launching an airstrike); not the most useful skill under the majority of circumstances, though her sister makes up for it with the always handy vanguard buff, but the real deal is the +35% Aviation buff that is further bolstered by the slew of extra stats the Kai brought, as well as the neat timed barrage (which is, despite its inconsistency, still free damage).  
Exceptional.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/ea/TaihouChibi.png "Taihou") - **[IJN Taihou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Taihou)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon completion of an airstrike cooldown, she has a 40% chance to launch a Saiun (increases own backline's Damage by 10% for 8s but deals no damage of its own), a 40% chance to launch a Suisei carpet bombing and a 40% chance to launch a Ryusei targeted torpedo strike.
  * Take -20% HE and Aviation damage.
  * Has a 2/3/3 loadout.

* Desc: Lady Luck is a bitch.
>Taihou is as fickle as she is horrifyingly powerful, equally suited to razing waves and demolishing single targets.
As the proud owner of not one, not two, but three whole separate plane 'barrges' and a bombardment-oriented plane loadout, she is guaranteed to set the oceans ablaze multiple times over, if given the chance(s) to do so - and even if said chances weren't forthcoming, her Heavy Armour, massive HP pool and defensive skill allow her to weather the storms until the next die can be cast.  
On a sidenote, she's also one of the carriers least affected by enemy AA boats due to the sheer volume of aircraft she can unleash. Nice.



### Tier 1:
---
![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/9f/Bunker_HillChibi.png "Bunker Hill") - **[USS Bunker Hill](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Bunker_Hill)** (T0.5 w/ USS BBs as flagship, T0.5 w/ CV/L)
* Skill: 
  * Gain +15% Aviation; if flagship, grant +15% Firepower to USS BBs; if not, grant +15% Firepower and AA to USS DDs.
  * If there are no other CV/L in the backline, grant +12% AA to it; upon launching an airstrike, launch a plane barrage whose pattern differs according to the number of CV/Ls in the fleet.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: USS, AUGmented.
>A very peculiar beast, this first USS sort-of-national-booster, but a very effective one nonetheless.  
While at first glance her skills may look like a schizophrenic mess, and to a certain extent they are, on closer inspection it's fairly easy to see what their intent is - boosting either dual battleship comps or full carrier ones as well as herself, in a remarkable display of versatility.  
You may have to rethink your fleet to accommodate her eccentricities, but she'll make sure it'll be worth it.


![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/69/IndependenceChibi.png "Independence") - **[USS Independence](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Independence)** (T0.5 w/ 1+ Cleveland-class around)
* Skill: 
  * Gains +15% Efficiency on a slot when using USS planes
  * Upon airstrike launch, scramble a TBF Avenger torpedo bomber; also, if sortied with at least 1 Cleveland-class CL, grant them +8% FP and gain +15% Accuracy/Aviation and launch 2 TBF Avengers instead.
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Very solid statline, extremely high efficiency planes and a plane barrage? That sounds too good to be true. Where's the catch?  
Well, beyond her being a CVL (ie. less planes, inferior statline compared to CVs), there really isn't one - beyond 'having' to take a Cleveland-class CL along to get the most of out of her 'barrage' (which is just one/two planes), which is a mutually beneficial relationship anyway, and having to mount US planes for similar reasons, which still ends up working in her favour.  
Tip - if you don't have the VT-8, resist the temptation to give her the regular TBF Avenger, as its cooldown is bad enough to make the usual Barracuda/Ryuusei still preferable, despite the Eff drop.


![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e0/RangerKaiChibi.png "USS Ranger Kai") - **[USS Ranger Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ranger)**
* Skill: 
  * 15% activation when launching an airstrike, the next airstrike becomes available immediately
  * 25% chance of inflicting double damage with airstrike
  * Has a 0/6/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Also referred to as RNGer for obvious reasons, and infamous because of her potentially infinite damage, you need luck on your side to get the most out of her; even without the procs, though, very few carriers get close to the sheer damage output she can unleash thanks to her 8 sea-attacking planes and high Efficiencies, and none of them can manage it at her rock-bottom 9 Oil cost.  
Beware her near-total lack of anti-air presence, though; without Fighters or AA guns to speak of, there's little she can do about enemy planes.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/dc/SaratogaKaiChibi.png "Saratoga Kai") - **[USS Saratoga Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Saratoga#retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * Every 10s, fires a 3x2-bullet HE salvo (dmg scales with Airpower).
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants +15% damage output to the vanguard for 8s.
  * Upon airstrike launch, 70% chance to deploy 3 aimed torps inflicting Ignition and Flooding from three planes.
  * Has a 2/6/0 loadout.
  
* Desc: Puella Magi Toga Magica.
>Saratoga's Kai doesn't significantly change her playstyle: she's still the powerful DB-focused CV she's always been, but with a considerably improved statline that further emphasises her strengths. Extremely solid, even from a HP standpoint.  
Her Kai skill, just like her gunfire skill, is best regarded as a bit of free additional damage than a reliable contribution to the fight - the extra planes have aimed torpedoes and the DoTs they inflict are fairly weak, but it's still better than most CV do in their downtime.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/3d/YorktownChibi.png "USS Yorktown") - **[USS Yorktown](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yorktown)**
* Skill: 
  * Once per battle, if Yorktown's HP falls below 20% she heals herself by 25%
  * Upon receiving damage and on a 20s cooldown, launches three special SBD dive bombers (x1 2000lb, x2 100lb); 
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants +15% damage output to the vanguard for 8s.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

- Desc: "Putting the 'fleet' in 'fleet carrier'".
> One of the hardiest and most well-rounded carriers in the game, Yorktown can cover any role admirably well, courtesy of her balanced plane loadout, her frontline buff, her self-heal and her personal SBD squadron, ready to bust the heads of whoever thought she was easy pickings.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/db/ShoukakuChibi.png "IJN Shoukaku") - **[IJN Shoukaku](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shoukaku)** **(T0 w/ Zuikaku)**
* Skill: 
  * On launching an airstrike, gives a fleetwide increase of damage dealt by 10% and reduces damage taken fleetwide by 10% for 12s
  * When paired, increases Air Power by 30% and INCREASES damage taken by 10%
  * Has a 2/2/4 loadout.

* Desc: 
>More support-based than her sister and frailer than she when her other half is around, but more than makes up for it thanks to the +30% Airpower she gets as well as the buffs she throws out (which incidentally also partially negate the debuff).  
Her buffs and layout are good enough to warrant usage even solo.


### Tier 1.5:
---
#### ![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/92/LangleyKaiChibi.png "USS Langley") - [USS Langley Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Langley)
* Skill: 
  * Increases experience gained by CV by 15%
  * Increases Reload for CVL by 15%, does not stack with other command skills that have similar effect. 
  * Has a 6/2/0 loadout.

* Desc:
>Once considered a liability due to the much reviled F/F/B loadout and an exp boost as a primary skill, Langley Kai's fortunes changed drastically with the advent of Air Superiority mechanics; not only do those fighters contribute almost or over twice the amount other types of planes do, but they're also extraordinarily cost-effective as well as slightly more readily available than usual.
If stacking AS is what you need but you'd rather not focus on carriers, look no further.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/33/LexingtonChibi.png "USS Lexington") ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/fb/SaratogaChibi.png "USS Saratoga") - **[USS Lexington](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Lexington)** **[USS Saratoga](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Saratoga)**
* Skill: 
  * Every 10s, fires a 3x2-bullet HE salvo (dmg scales with Airpower).
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants +15% damage output to the vanguard for 8s.
  * Have a 2/6/0 loadout.

* Desc: 
>These two ships are identical in use (albeit not in popularity, only Saratoga has a Kai to this day), and specialize in clearing smaller enemy fleets due to their bomber focus and special salvo.  
They don't launch fast, but when they do they really leave a mark - make sure to stagger the launches as to not overwrite the Damage buff, though.
 
 ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c4/Ark_RoyalChibi.png "HMS Ark Royal") - **[HMS Ark Royal](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ark_Royal)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, reduce all on-screen enemies' speed by 60% and launch 3 biplanes armed with 1 aimed torpedo each.
  * 25% chance to do double damage on Airstrike.
  * Has a 0/2/6 loadout.
  
* Desc: 
>A rare Torpedo-focused CV, coming stock with two TB slots and a skill that lets her launch even more WHILE slowing any enemy on the screen.   
Whether it's boss-busting or wave-clearing, give her the appropriate planes and she'll do a pretty good job - just don't expect much of anything from her terrible DBs, and definitely do not expect your carrier-based torp to magically all hit afterwards.
 
![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/0/00/IllustriousChibi.png "HMS Illustrious") - **[HMS Illustrious](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Illustrious)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants every vanguard unit a shield for 10% of Illustrious' max HP, lasting 8s.
  * Has a 6/0/2 loadout.

* Desc: Zero to (AS) Hero.
>A very defensive-focused CV with double fighter slots, a shield generator and staggering amounts of Air Superiority. Her low DPS is the stuff of legend.    
Her niche is providing air superiority and protecting the frontline from harm through her shields - helpful, and while they won't replace proper healer support, they WILL help with skills proccing on damage sustained (eg. Eldridge) and keeping vanguards light on HP (eg. DDs) running for longer, especially on torpedo strikes.



![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/53/Graf_ZeppelinChibi.png "KMS Graf Zeppelin") - **[KMS Graf Zeppelin](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Graf_Zeppelin)** **(T0 w/ other KMS units)**
* Skill: 
  * 30% increase in efficiency for equipped German planes
  * All KMS ships in fleet take 15% less damage.
  * Has a 2/6/0 loadout.

* Desc: IT'S NOT JUST A PHASE, MEIN KOMMANDANT!
>The single toughest CV in the game, courtesy of her ludicrous HP pool (6.8k), the flat damage cut she extends to every KMS unit in the fleet (herself included) and the couple of 150% ME155s she can field to keep the skies clear; and as for the offence, she's no slouch either with her remarkable six 160% Efficiency Stukas.  
Her only real flaw is her lacking Reload, a mere 100 compared to most other top-of-the-line carriers - and, of course, her lack of synergy with non-KMS units, so keep her in there and she'll do work.

#### ![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/62/RyuujouChibi.png "Ryuujou") - **[IJN Ryuujou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ryuujou)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, 70% chance for +15% Aviation (self) and +15% Reload (all CVL) and -15% damage received (all CV/L) for 8s
  * 5 seconds after her first two airstrikes, launches 3 additional Suisei (dropping x1 1000lb bomb, x2 100lb bombs).
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>A decent little cheerleader for the rest of your carriers, armed with a limited complement of surplus Suisei to throw out and a solid statline to supplement the smattering of buffs she throws out. Ok.


### Tier 2:
---
![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/db/HornetChibi.png "USS Hornet") - **[BIG WASP YO (USS Hornet)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hornet)**
* Skill: 
  * 60% chance to drop 12 additional bombs with her airstrike upon launch
  * 25% chance to inflict double damage with her airstrike.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Once a meme, now a force to be reckoned with. Think of her as a barrage boat in carrier form - her main job is blasting ships into smithereens, and she does that remarkably well with two powerful skills dedicated precisely to that and a solid statline.  
Just don't expect much in the way of support, beyond the air coverage provided by her okay fighters.

 #### ![CVL](https://i.imgur.com/te8TrVP.png "Chaser") - [HMS Chaser](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Chaser)
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, 15% chance to immediately reload it.
  * Upon airstrike launch, reveal all submarines on the screen for 10s and launch three biplanes armed with depth charges and two parallel torpedoes each.
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Chaser had a look at Ranger before leaving for the Royals and realised she was up to something good.  
With functionally 9 planes at her back and call without giving up her AA guns or high Reload, she can handily rival most other CVL in DPS while keeping some support capabilites to her credit - as well as a decent chance to throw out torrents of planes.  
That said, she's still mostly an attack craft - her ASW capabilties, while a nice touch, are entirely useless on non-ASW maps and unnecessary there, given how easily dealt with subs are.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/97/ZuikakuChibi.png "IJN Zuikaku")- **[IJN Zuikaku](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Zuikaku)** **(T0 w/ Shoukaku)**
* Skill: 
  * Increases next airstrike damage by 20% on launching airstrike, stacks up to 3 times
  * When paired, increases Air Power by 20% and takes 20% less damage
  * Has a 2/3/3 loadout.
  
* Desc: 
>An extra-tough carrier designed for prolonged fights, which basically means 'boss battles only'.  
Her skill barely contributes to most battles, and without her sister ship she's missing out a fair chunk of the stats that let her ramp up be as effective as it can be.

### Honourable Mentions:
---
#### ![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/1/16/BogueKaiChibi.png "USS Bogue Kai") - **[USS Bogue Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Bogue)**
* Skill: 
  * 15% activation when launching an airstrike, the next airstrike becomes available immediately
  * Increases AA for backline by 15%, does not stack with other command skills that have similar effect.
  * Has a 3/3/0 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Similar in concept and usage to Ranger, her airstrikes come out faster but don't provide close to the same weight of fire.  
Still, high plane efficiency coupled with a neat AA buff for the backline allows her to be decently useful and cost-effective in most situations.

#### ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/1/1b/WaspChibi.png "USS Wasp") - [USS Wasp](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Wasp)
* Skill: 
  * When deployed w/ at least 1 HMS backliner and upon airstrike launch, 50% chance to launch a Spitfire squadron.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

- Desc: "SMOL WASP YO"
>The cheapest CV in the game, by virtue of her Blue rarity... and that's pretty much it, as far as remarkable features go.  
Her staline is somewhat lacklustre, her skill doesn't add much to her DPS and pushes you into using HMS backliners.  
While definitely usable, her only real use case would be plugging Hard Mode enforced ship requirements.

#### ![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/ff/HoushouChibi.png "IJN Houshou") - [IJN Houshou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Houshou)
* Skill: 
  * Increases experience gained by CV/L by 15%
  * +15% Aviation to all CV/L for 8s after Houshou launches an airstrike.
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout... and a CL gun.

* Desc: 
>The first carrier to ever sail the seas, and it shows. As THE early prototype for the ships that would later dominate the oceans, she's incredibly weak and brought further down by her mandatory CL gun - which can barely deal scratch damage, owing to her 0 Firepower statline.  
Why is this even mentioned, then? Because her +XP skill stacks with Langley's, that's why, and having her around as a 0LB exp booster may be a good idea to hasten the leveling process.

#### ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/ba/FumiruiruChibi.png "Fumirul") - [Fumirul](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fumiruiru)
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, 60% chance to heal the unit with the lowest current HP by 10% of its max HP.
  * 10s after battle start and every 20s afterwards, fires a narrow beam-like barrage straight ahead.
  * Has a 2/0/6 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Despite her predictably awful statline - it's a collab ship, after all - Fumirul has some interesting tricks up her oversized sleeves that might, just might, justify taking her along.
First is her heal, which unlike most other heals can somewhat reliably affect the backline too, which in turn makes her quite valuable in BB-heavy environments where the flagship is often exposed to enemy fire; second is her FREAKIN' LAZOR BEAM, which is both badass and nasty, though hampered by its strictly linear nature.
Interesting and potentially useful, just don't expect to see her launch often.

### A few preliminary notes

"Submarines" are powerful but specialized tools that behave rather differently from your ordinary fleets.
Here's a quick rundown of how they work.

1. You cannot control them directly; each sub has her own hunting pattern and different priorities when it comes to movement, and the fleet will stay within the boundaries of its lead sub's hunting range.
2. Submarine fleets move up to 2 squares per turn to automatically attack enemy nodes within range, shaving off up to 20% max HP (more with submarine-boosting meowfficers) off of ALL enemies in the node, and may also be summoned in battle if your regular fleets are fighting within hunting range. Map strike damage depends on the sub fleet's overall Power Rating, in-battle damage depends on the usual mechanics.
3. Submarine fleets in battle act as a sort of tactical nuke button; when summoned they will join the fight in person and unleash inordinate amounts of torpedoes via barrages to brutalize everything unfortunate enough to be on screen at the time, then stay for roughly 20s (exact amount depends on their Oxygen stat, with 10 Oxy equaling 1s) firing their 'regular' torpedoes until they run out of O2 and have to surface.
4. Submarine statlines are generally very similar to one another, barring a few exceptions; as it is with BBs and BCs, skills are the main discriminant here.

Given these premises, it quickly becomes apparent that **submarine fleets are meant to be fielded as a trio**; whether it be mauling nodes on the map or providing heavy torpedo support, they only reach peak efficiency as a full fleet, and in the case of map strikes such efficiency comes at no oil cost whatsoever.
As such, this section *does not contain tiers* but specific recommendations and groupings - let's get to them.

#### ![SS](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/90/U-47Chibi.png "U-47") ![SS](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/94/U-81Chibi.png "U-81") ![SS](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/ed/U-557Chibi.png "U-557") - [KMS U-47](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/U-47), [KMS U-81](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/U-81), [KMS U-557](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/U-557) 
* Skill (U-47): 
  * If U-47 damages an enemy with a torpedo, her next torpedo within 5s will inflict +40% damage.
  * If sortied solo, gain +20% Damage vs BBs, +2 Ammo and +1 Search Level.
  
* Skill (U-81): 
  * Deal +20% Damage to CV; also, U-81's torps have a 15% chance to inflict Flooding (DoT similar to Ignition; 3s ticks, multiple procs do not stack but refresh duration) for 24s.
  * Gain +40% Evasion; also, gain +7% Torp, Reload and Accuracy for every KMS sub in the fleet.

* Skill (U-557): 
  * Deal +15% Damage to CL.
  * Gain +6% Torpedo and Reload for every KMS sub in the fleet.

* Desc: Achtung - U-Boot!
>Given real world Germany's history with submarines, it comes as no surprise that the Ironblood gets the apex specimens of their class.  
Simple yet brutally effective, this KMS trio lacks the utility other compositions may offer but make up for it by having the best in-battle damage - partly because of their skills, and partly because of their homing barrages. Just make sure to give them snorkels to offset their low Oxygen stat.  
While you may be tempted to use U-47 solo, don't - there's little to gain from it and much to lose.

#### ![SS](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/96/AlbacoreChibi.png "Albacore") ![SS](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/0/0f/DaceChibi.png "Dace") ![SS](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c6/I-26Chibi.png "I-26") ![SS](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/4b/I-58Chibi.png "I-58") - [USS Albacore](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Albacore), [USS Dace](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Dace), [IJN I-26](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/I-26), [IJN I-58](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/I-58)
* Skill (Dace): 
  * Deal +15% Damage to CA.
  * Gain +40 Oxygen.
  
* Skill (Albacore): 
  * Deal +10% Damage to DD, CL and CV.
  * Launches a special torpedo barrage with 70% Ignition chance upon surfacing.

* Skill (I-26): 
  * Deal +15% Damage to CV.
  * Gain +40 Oxygen.
  
* Skill (I-58): 
  * Deal +15% Damage to CA; also, launches a special toepedo barrage upon surfacing.

* Desc: O2 Jamming.
>A rather diverse bunch of girls, these ones, but they all share a trait - their Oxygen tanks are ample enough to accommodate for two full Mark 16 torpedo volleys, which means they can safely be ran with dual Oxygen Torpedoes.  
Albacore is the best of the bunch, courtesy of her wider selection of preferred enemies as well as barrage quality and availability, but that's not to say the others are bad.

* Skill: 
  * Upon joining the battle, grant +20% Accuracy to the vanguard.
  * Upon surfacing, fire her barrage and stay on the field for 12s longer.
  * Mounts a unique CA gun instead of the regular DD guns. It's good.

* Desc: On v ya!
>Surcouf is unique among subs for several reasons, not least of which her ability to stand her ground while surfaced.
Firstly, her guns are not only actually useful but also threatening; secondly, she bolsters the vanguard's fighting prowess with a hefty Accuracy buff; thirdly, she stays on the field for longer than anyone else while making full use of her entire armament throughout it all.
Her one downside is a subpar hunting range, but she's not meant to stay front and centre anyway.

* Skill: 
  * Upon joining the battle, launch a unarmed Saiun and grant +10% Damage to the backline.
  * Gain +40 Oxygen.
  * Mounts a pair of Seaplanes instead of the regular DD guns. Still better than DD guns, and actually good if said seaplanes are Seiran.

* Desc: Say What? to Blue Alien.
>Ah yes, submarine carriers - yet another of those wacky and not really effective IJN designs which to this day garner popularity, if only because of how unhinged they were.  
I-13 is the first of her class to reach Azur Lane, and despite the very mixed historical results, she puts on an impressive showing here - the damage buff is extremely welcome, the extra Oxygen nixes the need for a snorkel, her hunting range is comfortably wide and her Seiran can make a real contribution to the fight.  
On the flipside, her barrage is extremely linear and runs the very real risk of being entirely wasted if sortied as a sideliner.

* Skill: 
  * 8s after joining the battle, launches a wave of penetrating torpedoes (up to 2 pierces, similarly to AP shells).
  * I-19's torpedoes lose 1 Speed and deal +12% Damage.
  
* Desc: 
>An attack sub through and through, armed with a rather powerful penetrating barrage and stronger torpedoes stock.  
Them being slower isn't as much of a hindrance as it sounds at first - given the long distances from which subs launch, a slow torpedo has a greater chance to catch the original target on its way back.

### A few notes, and Vestal

"Repair Ship" is a misnomer for these crafts, to say the least. Here are the reasons why ---> https://pastebin.com/RucY4TwC  
TLDR; they contribute little to nothing to the fight, their healing is pathetic and vastly outclassed as soon as you use more than a single DD for your vanguard, the +1 ammo is easily negated by a single ambush (and given the inability to attack surface targets they can't assist the fleet in the battle either) and they cost the same as the much superior healer options (Unicorn / Shouhou / Arizona).  
However, **Vestal** - unlike Akashi - has a few redeeming features that make her worth taking along for lategame low(ish)-cost farming, provided you don't mind the increase in clearing times.

* Skill: 
  * Once per battle, Vestal heals a ship under 20% HP by 20% of the healed's HP; if the target is Enterprise, the healing amount is increased by 50%.
  * Begin each Sortie with 3 Emergency Repairs (consumable +10% fleetwide HP heals, used in the map screen). 
 
* Desc: "Vestal is Bestal".  
>"Wait, Vestal? Why not Akashi? Isn't her heal better?", you may be asking yourself - and you'd be right, Akashi's healing capacity is technically better. And it doesn't matter in the slightest.  
As covered above, Repair Ships are *terrible* healers and far outshone by cheaper/stronger/both options; competing with them is a lost cause.  
What you seek in a Repair Ship is utility, and Vestal brings a surprising amount of it to the table: be it through her rescue skill, guaranteed to save an ailing backliner's sorry arse, her stellar AA suite (two AA gun slots, each benefiting from the ARs' inbuilt +1 AGM, and three auxiliary slots you can fill with AA radars to kick her plane offence into high gear), and the usual 3 fleetwide consumable heals.  
She won't clear quick and she's obviously more suited to high-AA environments, but she *will* get the job done.
