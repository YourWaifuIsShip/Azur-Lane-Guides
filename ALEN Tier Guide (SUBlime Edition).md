# Your Waifu is SHIP's opinionated & extra-biased EN tier guide (based on Kopfjäger's work)

## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
Azur Lane is a special little gem of a game. In a mobile market saturated by predatory, thinly disguised gambling simulators posing as RPGs, where the only valid choice is the rarest, most expensive, most lootboxable one, Azur Lane bucks the trend by having ALL of its units entirely viable for all content, given proper gear and care.

That said, however... to quote a wise Azur Lane Community member, "just because it works, it doesn't mean it's good": while all units are indeed viable, there are clearly objectively superior ones, and this Tier Guide aims to identify who are they and for what reasons.
Indeed, you could even interpret the tiers as a relative measure of how much investment is needed to get these units to perform, if you wish - a T0 would be a beast almost right out of the gate, whereas an untiered unit would require disproportionate amounts of effort - but I'd recommend treating the tiers as they're meant to be, according to the criteria below.

Whatever the case and however you choose to read this guide, I want to stress this - ALL units are viable, SOME are better than others, NONE of them will work if you don't know how to use them.
Good reading, and godspeed cap'n!
## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
 
  
  
### Evaluation Criteria:
- Ships are tiered by their PvE PERFORMANCE first and foremost, but notes on notable PvP usage will be made if suitable.
- Ships are tiered according to their ability to act as a STAND-ALONE unit.
- Ships unable to fulfil the above criterion (eg. carriers as a whole, Vestal) are rated according to their ability to act as a SUPPORT unit; buffs/debuffs/aa/heals garner higher ranks than sheer damage output, especially during boss fights. See assorted notes for reasoning.
- Ships are compared to others in their OWN CLASS for tiering purposes; if two ships are have comparable stats and purpose, the least expensive one will be ranked higher.
- Ships in a tier are listed alphabetically and in order of nationality (USS -> HMS -> IJN -> KMS).
- All units are assumed to be MAXED (ie. lv100, BiS gear, SL10 across the board).
- Auto or Manual performance is not taken into consideration, unless it is specifically relevant to the unit.
- Submarines will NOT be tiered until more data on their live, peak performance is collected. This will take a while, folks.
- The Retrofit Priority List orderings are decided on the basis of how effective is the retrofitted unit, not how much does it need the retrofit; in other words, the better (more powerful/more useful) the retrofit, the higher it is.
  
  
  
#### Tier Explanations:
- Tier 0                : The best of the best, rivaled by few and matched by none. They set the bar for everyone else.
- Tier 0.5              : Terrifyingly effective units with little to no real competition in their class or function, usually by virtue of exceptionally strong skills and statlines.
- Tier 1                : Generally very effective units, albeit marred by some minor flaw that can be easily overlooked or fixed.
- Tier 1.5              : Niche, quirky or plain but solid, these units can perform their roles well but will need to be handled with care.
- Tier 2                : Very niche and/or flawed but still noteworthy, these units can nevertheless do you good but will require serious work to get them to.
- Not Tiered            : Ships that range from 'usable' to 'bottom of the barrel', but in both cases not good enough to make it on the list.
- Pro Team Players      : Ships that, while unremarkable on their own, become exceedingly good when deployed with each other. They are tiered as a single unit.
- Honourable Mentions   : Ships that, while too weak or unwieldy for general usage, nonetheless possess some interesting or useful quirk that may warrant attention.
  
  
  
#### Retrofit/Kai Priority List:
- DD                  : Laffey > Ayanami = Z23 > Cassin/Downes > Tanikaze > Javelin > Fortune
- CL                  : Jintsuu > Leander > Ping Hai/Ning Hai > Abukuma > Ajax/Achilles
- CA                  : Mogami > Portland > Furutaka/Kako > Suffolk
- BB/C                : Yamashiro/Fusou (DO NOT TAKE LAST TWO NODES) > Nevada/Oklahoma > Warspite*
- CV/L                : Ranger = Shouhou > Langley
  
  
  
#### Assorted notes:
- Read the VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE at the top.
- The 'loadout' listed under CV/L entries details the number of planes each unit gets; eg. Unicorn gets 3 Fighters / 0 Dive Bombers / 3 Torpedo Bombers.
- The asterisk next to a name in the Priority List means the Kai is tied to some sort of event and may not be available right now; also, if you do not see a name in it, it's because it is not worth prioritizing.
- If you're wondering why carriers are judged differently from the rest, consider the following - they have no self-defence capabilities against suicide boats and are inherently worse than big guns at handling hard targets due to ordnance scatter and unhelpful anti-Heavy modifiers, but their AoE damage dispatches waves better than big guns usually do and come stock with screen clears.
tldr; BB/BC and CV/CVL do different things, holding them to the same standards makes little sense

  
  
#### Credits:
- This guide is far from a solo effort: while the writing is mine, the tierings are researched and approved collegially with Gurosebe#4054, Enbayft#2527, Cantarella#7963 and the #helpful fellows over at the Azur Lane English Community server, while the coding framework that makes this possible was provided by Enbayft#2527 and improved upon by Boz#5174.  
Without these people, the Tier Guide would never be as comprehensive, accurate or good-looking as it is, and it is to them that I extend my sincere gratitude.

## DD ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/thumb/f/f6/DD_img.png/45px-DD_img.png "DD Icon")
### Tier 0:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b8/LaffeyKaiChibi.png "Laffey Kai") - **[USS Laffey Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Laffey#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% activation upon firing, increases own FP, Reload, and Evasion by 40% for 8s.
  * Every 20 seconds, has a 70% chance to active Vanquish Mode, increasing own Reload stat by 200% for 10 seconds and releasing a powerful barrage.
  
- Desc: "Vorpal Bunny".
>While pretty good to begin with, once Kai'd Laffey truly stands out thanks to CL-tier Firepower and Efficiency coupled with absurd amounts of Reload, allowing her to akimbo gun down any fool standing in her way. Her torpedoes also come out much quicker than anyone else's, but given the lacking nature of US torps spamming them is one of the few ways to keep them relevant.  
The DPS monster to AyaKai's DPH.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b4/YukikazeChibi.png "Yukikaze") - **[IJN Yukikaze](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yukikaze)**
* Skill:
  * While alive in fleet, the backline takes -8% dmg and, once per battle, heals any backliner under 20% HP for 10% of the healed unit's max HP.
  * 25% chance to activate when taking damage, decreases said damage to 1. 
  * Her regular barrage includes 4 conventional torpedoes.

* Desc: "She protecc, she attacc, but most importantly, she tsun catt".
>Nowhere as devastating as her tier companions (or a good few other IJN DDs for that matter), she is nonetheless quite powerful and has incredible defensive skills for both herself and the backline. Also, her barrage gets a few torps thrown into it for good measure.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/47/Z23KaiChibi.png "Z23 Kai") - **[KMS Z23 Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z23#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Firepower by 60% for 8s
  * Every 20 seconds, has a 40% (70%) chance to active Destruction Mode, releasing a powerful barrage and spawning 2 rotating shields that can block 5 enemy shells each, and for 10 seconds own main gun critical rate becomes 100%.
  * Can equip CL guns, but shouldn't.

* Desc: "Gun Fuhrer".
>Z23 takes the opposite approach to Ayanami, in that she goes all in on guns - her base FP is unmatched among DDs and her skills further ehnance her gun DPS to obscene degrees, while also having great uptime.  
Torps are even more of an afterthought than they are on Laffey, however, and unlike Laffey she can't make up for it by simply spamming them; she will punch ship-sized holes in Light and Medium Armour, but she'll find herself a little stumped against Heavy.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/2b/Z46Chibi.png "Z46") - **[KMS Z46](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z46)**
* Skill:
  * Whenever enemy planes are shot down within own AA range, increase FP by 15% of own total AA stat (Only base stat and gear is counted) and if skill procs again during its duration, it refreshes the buff
  * Increases AP damage by 25%
  
* Desc: "KMSan Diego".
>The last word in terms of DD AA and well capable of going toe-to-toe with most CL on their own field of expertise, while being vastly superior in terms of damage output, survivability, ASW prowess and - most importantly - barrage quality.  
Proud owner of a quick-firing, high-volume, AP conal barrage with four homing torpedoes to the side that is boosted both by her own +APdmg skill (do not take AP DD guns unless you hate her) and her high torp stat, she puts every other standard DD barrage in the game to shame and is the main reason for her astounding effectiveness; the AA proficiency is a nice cherry on top, but not her main draw.

### Tier 0.5:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/8b/AyanamiKaiChibi.png "Ayanami Kai") - **[IJN Ayanami Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ayanami#Retrofit)** **(T0 vs Bosses)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Torpedo by 60% for 8s
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost Evasion stat by 30% for 5s

* Desc: "Nuclear Launch Detected".
>Ayanami is the last word in Torp Damage - with her skill procced, the damage she can inflict with them is completely unrivaled and, with enough buff stacking, can even exceed the tens of thousands.  
On the flip side, Torpedoes are all she's got and once she's blown her load, she won't have much to do except waiting for them to come back online. The DPH monster to LafKai's DPS.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c3/YuudachiChibi.png "Yuudachi") - **[Poi (IJN Yuudachi)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yuudachi)**
* Skill:
  * 6% chance on Main Gun fire for +40% FP/Torp/Evasion/Reload to self.

* Desc: 
>Outclassed by 3/4 Starter Kai, but still very valid. Her superior statline, her Laffey-like generalist buff that pretty much boosts EVERYTHING worth boosting on a DD and an excellent barrage let her crank out a lot of DPS even when her torps are offline.  
The general strat is to gear her with a super-fast DD gun to proc her skill+barrage as often as possible.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/8e/KagerouChibi.png "IJN Kagerou") - **[IJN Kagerou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kagerou#Default)**
* Skill:
  * 15% boost of torpedo stat to the frontline
  * 30% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch

* Desc: 
>A relatively common ship that packs a LOT of punch. Combines high torpedo stat with double-torplaunch proc and a vanguard-wide torpedo boost.


### Tier 1: 
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/fd/CassinKaiChibi.png "Cassin Kai") ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/28/DownesKaiChibi.png "Downes Kai")- **[USS Cassin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Cassin#Retrofit)** **[USS Downes Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Downes#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * When HP falls under 20%, heals 25% of max HP once per battle
  * 60% chance to activate every 20 seconds, increase own Reload by 40% for 10 seconds

- Desc: "The bubblewrap fights back!"
>Packing a lot of Firepower for destroyers and blessed with a decent Reload buff to go along the excellent self-heal, Cassin and Downes may not have the monstrous damage output of their IJN counterparts but they can and will outlast them many times over.  
As it is for Phoenix, they are best used in mobbing fleets.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/63/ShiranuiKaiChibi.png "Shiranui Kai") - **[IJN Shiranui Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shiranui#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 30% chance upon torpedo launch to launch a second spread
  * When alive in fleet, allied CV/L take -15% damage

- Desc:
>Ah, the wonders of Kai. Shiranui goes from an excellent 0LB DD meme to a supremely legit pick for normal play, owing to her much improved torp stat and efficiency. The CV/L protection skill is nice to have, too.
 
 
### Tier 1.5:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/37/MauryChibi.png "USS Maury") - **[USS Maury](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Maury)**
* Skill:
  * 40% chance every 10s to raise evasion by 60% for 8s
  * Upon launching torpedoes, 30% chance to launch a second spread

* Desc: 
>Good double torpedoes and merely okay guns? On my USS DD? It's more likely than you think.  
Maury does things differently from many of her colleagues, but she does them well - despite not quite reaching the torp heights of the IJN or the gunnery of the KMS, she strikes a comfortable balance between the two factions and proves a reliable, independent addition to most fleets.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/f3/JavelinKaiChibi.png "Javelin Kai") - **[HMS Javelin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Javelin#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Evasion by 60% for 8s
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost torpedo stat by 30% for 5s

* Desc: 
>While her starter version is pretty much undeniably the worst out of the three, the Kai does her some justice. Still nowhere as powerful as Ayanami or Laffey, but the EX barrage helps to close the gap while her Evasion is and remains the absolute best in the game.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/6b/FubukiChibi.png "IJN Fubuki") - **[Bucky (IJN Fubuki)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fubuki)**
* Skill: In battle, increases evasion by 30% and torpedo stat by 10% of all Tokugata (herself, Ayanami, Akatsuki, Ikazuchi, Inazuma) destroyers in same fleet.

* Desc: 
>The best buddy Ayanami will ever have, and she's damn good on her own too owing to her very high Evasion and Torpedo stat.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/eb/TanikazeKaiChibi.png "IJN Tanikaze Kai") - **[IJN Tanikaze Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Tanikaze#Retrofit)**
* Skill:
  * When only escort ship alive, increase own evasion by 10% and reduce damage taken from airstrike to self by 50%
  * When her torpedo hits an enemy, 17% chance to make said enemy take 40% more damage from all torpedoes for 8s.

* Desc:
>Tinykaze sacrifices almost every part of her statline for exceptionally powerful torpedoes and a torpedo-boosting debuff.  
Devastating if the stars align and the debuff procs on her first torp hit, but little more than a dead weight while she's stuck reloading. Handle with care.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/55/Z25Chibi.png "Z25") - **[KMS Z25](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z25)**
* Skill:
  * 60% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40% for 10s
  * Reduces the damage taken by the Flagship by 25%; can equip CL guns.
  * Can equip CL guns (but shouldn't).

* Desc: 
>Best of the three ships with the Flagship Protection skill, not only does she have powerful guns and high HP for her class but she also synergises beautifully with her intended protégé, Graf Zeppelin - who can protect her in turn.  
That said, if you have no need for such a skill you should probably look for another ship.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/4b/Z35Chibi.png "Z35") - **[KMS Z35](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z35)**
* Skill:
  * 70% activation every 20s, increase firepower by 50% and Reload by 200% for 10s
  * Upon expiration, decrease reload by 100% for 3s.

- Desc: "Vorpal Häschen"
>Z35 takes a page from Laffey's book and kicks her guns into overdrive, putting them to similar effect (and wrekcing them in the process for a few seconds).  
Very similar in behaviour to her USS counterpart, but whereas she can run a one-bunny show thanks to her Kai statline and skills, Z35 needs Z1's presence to really compare; and while she won't be matching her anytime soon, she'll still be giving many other DDs a run for their money.


### Tier 2:
---
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/36/Charles_AusburneChibi.png "Charles Ausburne") - **[USS Charles Ausburne](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Charles_Ausburne)** **(T1.5 w/ CA, T0.5 w/ Fletcher)** 
* Skill:
  * 4% activation upon firing, increases Fleet movement speed, and Escort evasion by 40% for 8s
  * 60% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40% for 10s.

* Desc: 
>Another slippery little bastard, obsessed with justice and GOING FAST.  
Her torps are fairly worthless, but her guns are decent and her skill is absolutely amazing - not only does she increase your whole frontline's survivability, she also fixes whatever movement issues you might have at hand. The best DD friend your CAs could ever have.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/8b/EldridgeChibi.png "USS Eldridge")- **[USS Eldridge](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Eldridge)**
* Skill:
  * Upon taking damage, 15% chance to make entire escort fleet to evade all attacks for 10s. DoT and Ramming damage still apply. CAN'T PROC BEFORE 20s HAVE PASSED (skill starts on cooldown).

* Desc: 
>Slippery little bastard, despite her CA-like movement speed. Her offensive stats are somewhat lacklustre, but she makes up for it with her skill - it might be RNG and her high Evasion works against it, but 10s of invulnerability is nothing to scoff at. Make sure to have her eat weak shots to minimise exposure to dange.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/33/FletcherChibi.png "USS Fletcher") - **[USS Fletcher](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fletcher)** **(T0.5 w/ Charles Ausburne and Nicholas)**
* Skill:
  * Increases Firepower and Evasion of all Fletcher-Class in fleet by 30%
  * Increases Firepower, Torpedo, and Reload of DDs in the fleet by 10%

* Desc: 
>Lynchpin of the Fletcher Trio, think of her as an USS Z1 with a greater focus on gunnery as opposed to torps, as befitting her nation's doctrine. Very solid and dependable, but obviously better with other Fletchers.
 
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/64/NicholasChibi.png "USS Nicholas") - **[USS Nicholas](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nicholas)** **(T1.5 w/ Fletcher)**
* Skill:
  * 5% chance on main gun fire for +40% Evasion and -40% plane damage to self for 8 seconds
  * 60% chance every 20s for +40% Firepower to self.

* Desc: 
>The Nick is a true generalist, competent in everything and excelling in nothing.  
Good gunnery with a skill that supports it, good Evasion with a proc-on-fire skill for maximum uptime, comparatively high HP, okay torps, okay AA; solid all around, but easily outshone in any of these areas by more dedicated units.  
Make sure to bring a Fletcher along to capitalise on her strenghts.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/a/a2/MakinamiChibi.png "IJN Makinami") - **[IJN Makinami](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Makinami)**
* Skill: 
  * 30% chance to launch a second salvo on Torpedo launch
  * Every 20s, 60% chance to boost Firepower by 40%
  
* Desc:  
>Aww, how adorable, she thinks she can actually deal damage what that IJN DD(tm) peashooter she's got!  
Her torp game is still legit, if nothing else, and she'll be a decent placeholder for the superior and cheaper Kuroshio/Oyashio, whenever they'll come.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/88/ShigureChibi.png "IJN Shigure")- **[IJN Shigure](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shigure)**
* Skill: 
  * 5% chance on firing main gun to boost Evasion by 60% for 8s

* Desc: 
>Think Javelin before her Kai, except not terrible. Excellent stats, good skill, pretty good to use overall.
 
![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/eb/NiizukiChibi.png "IJN Niizuki")- **[IJN Niizuki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Niizuki)**
* Skill:
  * 25% chance every 20s, Increase entire fleet's Reload by 25% for 8s (does not stack with multiple instances of the same skill)
  * 25% chance on firing AA guns to boost AA by 40% and reduce Firepower by 20% for 3s. Has MGM+1.

* Desc: 
>An oddity among DDs and especially IJN ones, Niizuki focuses on AA and guns over torps - and does so with a decent measure of success, too.   
Despite her low FP and an AA skill actively hampering it, her MGM+1 and good Efficiency let her deal constant, solid damage regardless; she's no KMS or USS Gun-DD, but she puts up a good showing and still retains serviceable torps, as well as an unreliable but decent fleetwide buff.

![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/7/7c/Z1Chibi.png "KMS Z1") - **[KMS Z1](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z1)** **(T0 if running full Z-series setup)**
* Skill:
  * +40% FP and Eva to all KMS DD.

* Desc: 
>Z1's main use is for running the Z-class destroyer trio, where she provides a MASSIVE boost to her sisters. She herself is a pretty normal torpedo-focused DD statwise.
 
 
### Pro Team Players:
---
#### ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/cc/An_ShanChibi.png "Anshan") ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/20/Chang_ChunChibi.png "Changchun") ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/7/7f/Fu_ShunChibi.png "Fushun") ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/f5/Tai_YuanChibi.png "Taiyuan") - [PRAN Anshan](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/An_Shan), [PRAN Changchun](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Chang_Chun), [PRAN Fushun](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fu_Shun) [PRAN Taiyuan](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Tai_Yuan) **(T1.5)**
* Skill (Anshan): While in combat, Anshan-class (all PRAN) ships have increased Accuracy, Firepower by 25% and evasion by 10%
* Skill (Changchun): Increases Firepower, Reload and Accuracy by 12% for all North Union and Eastern Radiance (ROC, PRAN) ships in fleet.
* Skill (Fushun): Increase own main gun's critical rate by 20%.
* Skill (Taiyuan): While in combat with 6 ships in the fleet, increase own Firepower and Reload by 25%, and evasion by 10%.

- Description:
>This pack of cleverly disguised Gunboat CL possesses a staggering amount of Firepower and Reload for its class as well as somewhat higher HP, but it does so at the expense of their now almost worthless torpedoes.
Use Fushun if you don't want to pony up for a full fleet: her DPS won't be as stable as Taiyuan's, but she won't be far off and you'll be burning a lot less Oil.

#### ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/61/CrescentKaiChibi.png "Crescent Kai") ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/6e/CometKaiChibi.png "Comet Kai") ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/5f/CygnetKaiChibi.png "Cygnet Kai") [HMS Crescent Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Crescent), [Comet Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Comet), [Cygnet Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Cygnet#) **(T2)**
* Skill (Crescent): 30% activation every 20 seconds, evade all incoming attacks for 6 seconds || Deploys a smokescreen (+40% Evasion Rate for ships inside the smoke) for 5s at the beginning of the battle and every 15s after that at a 30% chance.

* Skill (Comet): increases the Torp stat of DDs in the fleet by 15%, does not stack with other command skills that have a similar effect || Deploys a smokescreen (+40% Evasion Rate for ships inside the smoke) for 5s at the beginning of the battle and every 15s after that at a 30% chance.

* Skill (Cygnet): 30% activation every 20 seconds, evade all incoming attacks for 6 seconds || Deploys a smokescreen (+40% Evasion Rate for ships inside the smoke) for 5s at the beginning of the battle and every 15s after that at a 30% chance.

- Description: "Da da da, smoke screen everydaaaay". 
>This group of HMS DD is mostly remarkable for their low Oil cost, high Evasion, and being the cheapest delivery vehicle in the game for mass smokescreens.  
Unusually for these sorts of teams, its members' statlines differ slightly: Crescent is shooty (high FP), Comet is torpy (high Torp), Cygnet is slippery (high Eva). Equip and wield them accordingly.
 
 
### Honourable Mentions:

#### ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/7/7c/CassinChibi.png "USS Cassin") ![DD](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c4/DownesChibi.png "USS Downes") [USS Cassin](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Cassin) & [USS Downes](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Downes)
* Skill:
  * Once per fight, restore 25% max HP upon falling under 20% HP.

* Desc: Cheap and inexpensive bubblewrap.
>While their Kai does augment their DPS somewhat, it's fair to say that the star of the show is still their self-rescue skill and their pretty good base HP; therefore, if all you want are some ablative wounds for a more valuable unit or just something to stall with while the backline does all the work, there are no better options than a 0LB Cassin and Downes.

* Skill:
  * +18% Exp gain for DDs.

* Desc: 
>The first real DD to hit the seas, and boy does it show. Her barely combat-worthy statline and lack of any skill beyond the XP boost makes her a very poor candiate for Limit Breaks, and a very good candidate for 0LB shenanigans.

  * +20% Reload and Torpedo to all DD/CL in Fleet
  
- Desc: "The fox says 'torp'."
>As far as torpedoes are concerned, this is what peak efficiency looks like. Sporting three different superb torpedo buffs for whoever has any business mounting them and stellar torpedo stats+efficiency, she's a powerhouse in her own right with access to a handy damage cut (which she needs, considering her abysmal HP pool) and an uncharacteristically good barrage.  
With no real weakness to speak of, her one significant flaw is not being able to bolster CA torpedoes - you'll want to look elsewhere for that.

  * 25% chance upon firing AA guns, -20% own FP and +40% own AA for 3s.
  
- Desc:
> Creme de la creme of the Cleveland class by virtue of a slightly superior statline (compared to her sisters'), an absolute bomb of a Cruiser buffing skill, and surprising amounts of Luck to make the most out of her already sturdy build.  
Most, if not all, Cruiser compositions will benefit by her presence.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/86/HelenaChibi.png "USS Helena") - **[USS Helena](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Helena)** **(T0 vs bosses)**
* Skill:
  * 20s 60% chance to inflict a -40% damage resistance debuff on all enemies currently on the screen.

* Desc: 
>Helena is exceedingly good against bosses and merely alright everywhere else.  
While the power of her debuff is unparalled, it's hard to make sure she will proc when you need her to - either because the enemy has died already or there's no worthy targets on the screen, as tends to happen on mob nodes, or because it just won't proc due to bad luck; only boss fights tend to drag on for long enough to guarantee her debuff will proc and get some use.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/fc/PhoenixChibi.png "USS Phoenix") - **[USS Phoenix](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Phoenix)**
* Skill:
  * Once per fight and upon falling below 20% HP, restore 25% HP and +30% FP for 15s.

* Desc: 
>Sturdy, cost-effective and perfectly capable of carrying a fleet through multiple battles with no healing support, Phoenix is a supremely reliable workhorse for any fleet; whether it's farming or a cheeky way to skimp on healers to ramp up the backline damage, she'll get it done.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/7/71/St._LouisChibi.png "USS St. Louis") - **[USS St. Louis](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/St._Louis)**

  * 25% chance on firing AA guns to boost AA by 40% and reduce Firepower by 20% for 3s

* Desc: "It's not luck, it's all skill".
>Lewdis' rather impressive statline goes exceedingly well with a solid set of self-buffs to all relevant stats for a Gun-CL like herself, letting her withstand amounts of punishment that would fell a lesser CL or fire harder and faster than much of her competition.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/d8/EdinburghChibi.png "HMS Edinburgh") - **[HMS Edinburgh](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Edinburgh)**

  * +25% AP dmg.

- Desc: "Worth her weight in gold."
>Edinburgh is in a similar situation as Cleveland: both have merely 'okay' skills, both have impressive statlines, both will stay in front and tank for days while the rest of the team gets the job done.  
The difference lies in how 'safe' they play things, as Edinburgh gets a passive boost to AP damage inflicted, an even bulkier HP pool (4.1k is amazing for both varieties of Cruiser) and no AA skill to burn her FP, but doesn't get that lone shot at the fleetwide buff and may find herself short-changed when planes ARE an issue.  
Still, there's very few finer, more reliable frontline tanks than she - and that's a definite plus.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/31/LeanderKaiChibi.png "HMS Leander Kai") - **[HMS Leander Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Leander)**
* Skill: 
  * Increases Firepower of Cruisers (both CL and CA) in the fleet by 15%
  * At battle start and 20% chance at every 20s thereafter, create a smokescreen that lasts 5s. Smokescreen provides 40% evasion

* Desc: A great statline, a discount price-tag, a Firepower buff for cruisers, a very annoying smokescreen for your PvP foes to deal with, and a smile to melt your heart. What's not to like?

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e7/SheffieldChibi.png "Sheffield") - **[HMS Sheffield](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Sheffield)**
* Skill:
  *  Allied ships with lower current HP than Sheffield at the start of battle have a 30% chance to take -50% dmg upon taking damage.
  * +12% CritRate and +30% CritDmg to self.

* Desc: Amazing how some spit and polish can enhance decimetres thick armour, isn't it?
>Rivaled by very few in the field of damage reduction buffs, Sheffield's defensive skill can greatly extend the survivability of almost any given vanguard, especially DD ones (provided she's placed in the middle and her HP has been raised above those she is meant to protect); and she'll do it while still being capable of packing a serious, if swingy, punch.
 
![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/cf/SiriusChibi.png "Sirius") - **[HMS Sirius](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Sirius)** **(T0 w/ carriers)**

  * Grant +10% Aviation and +10% HitRate vs DD/CL/CA to CV/Ls in the fleet; also, gain +7% Firepower/Torpedo/Reload for every CV/L in the fleet.
  * Gain +20% FP.
  * Can use DD guns, and should.
  
* Desc: Not [2B](https://i.imgur.com/jF188O7.jpg) taken lightly.
>Similar in a few ways to Jintsuu, Sirius offers a spectacular buff to a specific subset of units while benefiting greatly from it herself - significant enough to offset her otherwise unimpressive statline and really get the most out of her DD guns.
Gunnery is her main asset, and her barrage even more so - one of the absolute best as far as vanguards are concerned, very quick and hard-hitting despite the unassuming Normal shells, and unique in its narrowing pattern, which makes landing most of the shots from long range a rather simple task.  
That said, you will need to deploy a few carriers to get the full experience and with her barrage making up a significant portion of her overall DPS, her auto performance will suffer - handle with care. 
 
### Tier 1.5:

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/43/BrooklynChibi.png "USS Brooklyn") - **[USS Brooklyn](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Brooklyn)**
* Skill:

* Desc: 
>A full-gun alternative to Leander, somewhat sturdier than she is and in possession of a better barrage. Solid and a vital step on the road to Wichita.

  * 25% chance on firing AA guns to boost AA by 40% and reduce Firepower by 20% for 3s

- Desc: "The Original Dadster". 
>Units for whom the excellence of their statline outweighs a poor selection of skills are rare and far between, but there's few better examples than this than Cleveland.  
Sporting an impressive 3.8k HP, high Reload, slightly higher than usual Evasion and good guns, Cleve doesn't need skills to make her presence felt on the battlefield and excels as a tank; that said, while her AA skill is more of a detriment than a boon, her fleetwide boost is unreliable but potentially great.  
All in all, strong and dependable, just like her.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/a/a0/ColumbiaChibi.png "Columbia") - **[USS Columbia](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Columbia)**
* Skill:

- Desc:
>Ever wanted to use Hammann but didn't want to deal with her terrible stats and weaponry? Well, now you can.  
All the utility of her skills with the sturdiness and DPS of the Cleveland-class. Neat.

* Skill: 
  * 60% chance every 20s to boost Firepower by 40% for 10s
  * Increases damage dealt to CAs by 25%

*  Desc: 
>Ajax goes all in on the offensive, sporting a stellar FP/Torp stat bolstered by high efficiencies and a decent skillset - despite the questionable usefulness of the anti-CA buff.  
Powerful for her class and rather inexpensive, but beware the severely subpar HP.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/8/84/BelfastChibi.png "HMS Belfast") - **[HMS Belfast](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Belfast)**
* Skill: 
  * Increase HE damage by 25% and chance to ignite fire by 3% 
  * 10s after battle starts and 20% chance at every 20s thereafter, create a smokescreen that lasts 10s. Smokescreen provides 35% evasion and 35% reduced damage taken from airstrikes

* Desc: Hot maid, in more ways than one.
>Dealing more damage than usual with HE guns and packing better torps than every other HMS cruiser, she tends to have a good answer for most Light and Heavy Armour shaped issues - but not a great one on either side, and her smokescreen is almost entirely useless in PvE with its terrible procrate and planes not attacking you.  
Her place is strictly PvP, as there's many other HMS CL who will do what she does - be it DPS or tanking - better for less.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/7/7a/AbukumaKaiChibi.png "IJN Abukuma Kai") - **[IJN Abukuma Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Abukuma)**
* Skill: 
  * 15% boost of torpedo stat to every DD in the fleet
  * 30% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch

* Desc: 
>Abukuma is the IJN's very own Leander, now with 30% more torpedoes: out go the FP buff and she smokescreen, in come the DD Torp buff and a decent chance to fire her rather excellent torpedo launchers twice.  
Not too flashy, but sturdy enough and dependable.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/37/SendaiKaiChibi.png "Sendai Kai") - **[IJN Sendai Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Sendai#retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * +15% Torp and Reload to all DD/CL in the fleet.
  * 10s after battle start and on a 40% chance every 20s afterwards, deploys a flare (-25% Evasion Rate in the area) for 10s.

* Desc: 
>A slightly weaker Jintsuu who stole a few notes from Aurora's book.   
Her statline is still damn good, though, and their buffs can stack - as do the -EvaRate debuffs, if you REALLY want to stick it to those DD in PvP.

### Tier 2:

  * 25% upon firing AA guns, -20% FP and +40% own AA for 3s.

*  Desc: 
>The weakest of the Solomon Cavaliers, which means she's still pretty solid.  
She'll only buff herself, but a +40% FP never really goes amiss.

A solid pick regardless, especially if you expect aircraft

* Skill: 
  * Increases own damage against destroyers, transport vessels, torpedo boats, and suicide boats by 20% 
  * Decreases the evasion rate of all enemy destroyers and light cruisers by 20%.

*  Desc: 
>Excellent but niche DD/CL-busting skills paired with average CL stats, with the glaring exception of her sub-par HP.  
More suited for PvP than PvE, especially against HMS frontlines. Oh the irony.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/33/AganoChibi.png "Agano") - **[IJN Agano](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Agano)**
* Skill: 
  * +15% FP to DDs.
  * While alive, CV/L in the fleet take -15% damage.

* Desc: 
>Agano is an interesting little beastie, proud owner of an unconventional kit (DD FP boost, CV/L defence boost) and... less proud owner of a somewhat unremarkable statline for IJN CL, especially when compared to Sendai and Jintsuu.  
While she isn't a bad unit on her own by any stretch, her competitors are more powerful and their skills more wieldy and impactful than hers - which means her best use would be as a DD FP buffer, similarly to London.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/1/11/LeipzigChibi.png "KMS Leipzig") - **[KMS Leipzig](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Leipzig)**
* Skill: 
  * 10% FP/Eva/Reload to all CL/CA in the fleet.

* Desc: 
>Leipzig is a solid buff-provider, but is put down by her own somewhat lacking stats. Best used in an all-KMS lineup for maximum impact, as well as Torp-CA fronts, but she has a place in any frontline.

![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/5c/AvroraChibi.png "SN Avrora") - **[SN Avrora](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Avrora)**
* Skill: 
  * +35% Damage to the entire vanguard.
  * Has MGM+1 and Torpedoes.

- Desc: Союз нерушимый республик свободных~ ♪♫♬
>The burden and glory of the true revolutionary is heavy indeed, and Avrora shows it through and through.  
Her buff is the absolute best in the entire game, no exception allowed; she gets MGM+1 while keeping her torps, a rarity only six other ships have access to; and her Armour is Medium, letting her outlast a good number of her competitors.  
As amazing as all this sounds, she is let down by one glaring flaw - her abysmal offensive statline, which even her impressive buff struggles to shore up, compounded with pre-WW1-era engines that grant her the questionable honour of being the slowest ship in the game (tied with Yat Sen).  
All that said, unlike Yat Sen she is certainly usable; okay-ish on her own and an amazing force multiplier, having her around won't cut into your DPS to the point of crippling your fleet and will help your other ships MvP.

  * +25% Damage vs IJN units.
  * Can equip 2 CL guns and has AAGM+1.

- Description: The great wall of China.
>Obscenely slow (pre-Kai), pitiful HP and middling torps at best; Yat Sen is somewhat more interesting, with her double guns and twin AA mount, but her statline is severely lacking and has the questionable distinction of being tied with Avrora for slowest unit in the game.  
Nothing about these three looks usable, until you start deploying them together - at which point the sisters start evading better than basically anyone else in the game, even on the Single Line formation, achieveing unrivaled amounts of effective HP while dishing out respectable DPS besides.  
Lots of investment needed and Yat Sen MUST be protected at all costs (hint, place her between Ping and Ning), but they're the ultimate stonewall - if that's what you're looking for, it's worth it.
 
### Honourable Mentions:

#### ![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/66/JuneauChibi.png "USS Juneau") [USS Juneau](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Juneau)
* Skill: 
  * Upon sinking, heals the entire fleet by 25%.

- Desc: SHE DIES FOR YOUR SINS
>Cursed to die over and over again in PvP due to her ludicrously powerful healing skill, which can on its own change the course of a fight, this poor girl has little to no place in PvE as you do NOT want your units to die there in the first place and her offensive power is lacklustre at best.  
Her one job is being immensely irritating/powerful in the arena, and dying for you. You monster.
 
![CL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/9f/San_DiegoChibi.png "USS San Diego") - **[USS San Diego](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/San_Diego)**
* Skill: 
  * 15% chance upon firing AA guns, +50% AA to the entire fleet.

- Desc: "The undisputed, unwanted AA queen".
>San Diego has had, for the longest time, a terrible reputation - hailed as the prime example of rarity not being an indication of quality, her reputation is somewhat deserved, considering her main claim to glory is tons of AA (to the detriment of the rest of her offensive stats) when AA is only really needed in W12, a steep Oil price tag and a tendency to appear in crafting whenever you don't want her to... but that's not all there is to it.  
The usual claim is that San Diego can't do anything to surface enemies; if you were to use her as a normal CL this would be correct, as her FP is low and her Gun Efficiency is worse. However, her barrage can dish out surprising amounts of damage and she can mount DD guns, which means she can spam said powerful barrage; moreover, while her Torpedo stat is abysmal, her Torpedo Efficiency is good enough, meaning she can benefit a lot from auxiliary torpedoes.  
Does all this redeem her, then? Not really, even in this fashion, you'd need to manually control her and you'd need lots of high-end gear to get her to perform properly. If you're not expecting planes and you don't care about her, feel free to scrap her as you always did; if you do, then Sandy might just be what you need.

  * When Minneapolis' HP falls under 30%, lose 2 Speed but gain -10% damage sustained and heal 4% HP every 3s for 16s (can only proc once per fight).

- Desc: "Monster Hunter".
> Upgunned, uparmoured, upskilled and, alas, upcosted. In most regards, Minneapolis is indeed a direct step-up from Phoenix: her CA guns massively overpower her predecessor's CL ones, the Medium Armour cuts incoming gunfire damage in half, the heal is somewhat slower but comes with a handy damage resistance buff... but it's the +FP/Rld buff when taking enemies down that's the real deal and kicks her DPS into really high gear, as long as there's targets for her to take down.

  * Has MGM+1 and torpedoes.

- Desc: Oni-chan~
> Step aside Portland, there's a new best CA in the game - at least on the offense.
While she is definitely less tanky, missing the extra 800 HP and 11 Evasion Port gets, she casts a massive shadow over her DPS thanks to higher Firepower, better Main Gun efficiency, better offensive skills, a much better barrage and, most importantly, still getting Main Gun +1 despite the torps as if she were a gunboat.

  * 25% chance every 20s, +15% damage resistance to the entire fleet for 8s

* Desc: 
>Exceptional HP, twice the base Evasion other CAs get, high Firepower and high AA - in a similar fashion to Cleveland, her stats alone justify her rating and the skills are just icing on the cake.

* Skill:

  * 25% chance when firing main guns to fire another salvo

* Desc: Can you say 24 shots in a row? She certainly can.   
>Wichita brings to bear one of the absolute highest vanguard DPS in the game, owing to her Chain Cannon skill and the passive +15% FP.  
While her HP is rather lacklustre, it's an easily solved issue and dead enemies can't hurt you anyway.
 
 ### Tier 1:

* Skill: 
  * 30% chance upon Main Gun fire to double its shots' damage.

* Desc: 
>What was said about Wichita applies to Chicago as well. Slightly frailer than she is and more selfish, she will nonetheless punch hard and harder than anyone else when she does proc, which she often will - a proc on the first salvo lasts throughout the second, and the second salvo may still proc if the first one didn't.  
As a result, her double damage uptime is considerably higher than the 30% may lead you to believe. Bring out the big guns.

  * Take -20% damage from DD/CL gun attacks.

* Desc: 
>Leader of the New Orleans class, she emphasises their strengths and shares their reinforced armour plating.  
Solid and dependable, if unremarkable. No reason not to take her if you're going to field them at all, but Minneapolis has better things to do than hang out with her sisters.

* Skill:

- Desc: "Problem? What problem?"
>While an Evasion-focused CA sounds ludicrous, and it is under most circumstances, Houston actually makes it work given enough Evasion-boosting auxiliaries: CAs live and die by their Evasion (or lack thereof), so stacking it actually lets her survive under heavy fire for much longer than you'd expect.  
What issues she does have are fairly minor: she needs to proc to get tough, obviously, but her uptime is high and she has two chances to proc per firing cycle; and her damage output isn't as high as it could be, since her only skill is that Evasion buff, but it's still higher than most non-CA (and many Torp-CA) frontliners manage.

A good fit for mob- as well as boss-hunting, considering how frequent are DD and CL bosses, but beware their weaker guns and the need to take Astoria to make the most out of them.

>Too large for mere CA and too small for proper BCs, these Pocket Battleships are odd creatures.  
Capable of mounting a unique underchambered BB gun, they sport massive amounts of Firepower, a wide and severely damaging barrage and a raging hatred for anyone smaller than they (DD and CL) - but are let down by that same gun's AP element (which underperforms against DD and CL), their lower-than-average Speed and Evasion, and the weak torpedoes they're stuck with.  
A wrecking ball against small craft, to be sure, but watch out for when they pick a fight with people her size - and place Spee at the front, as she is slightly tankier than her sister.

* Desc: 
>HMS CA get a bad reputation for being frail and either undergunned or undertorped, despite possessing rather valuable skills.   
London is one such example, but she rescues herself from the mediocrity of her statline by virtue of being one of the only two frontliners that can buff DD FP - a small niche, admittedly, but a useful one if you plan on fielding multiple DD with good guns.

The second most gun-focused of the Takao-class, she provides the most stable output and a decent amount of it as well - though nowhere near as much as a Gun-CA would, or even Takao for that matter.

* Desc: 
>Maya trades Takao's double damage chance for a permanent passive reload boost. An interesting concept, and paired with double Autoloaders lets her fire her guns and torps faster than any other CA, which is remarkable on its own right... but is a rather poor trade nonetheless.
Also, she's slightly better at AA than her sisters (key word being "slightly", though).

  * Enemies hit by Duke of York's Main Gun fire take +12% damage from all sources for 8s; also, her first volley deals x1.5 damage.

- Desc: 
>With stats coming close to Warspite's stellar FP and Reload and a suite of skills aimed at softening the enemy up, not only she can lay on the hurt but she can also make sure her fellow warships do the same. A worthy inclusion in every fleet.

  * 70% chance on Main Gun fire, launches a frontal barrage (damage based on skill level), also if the fleet contains 4 or more Sakura Empire ships she gains -45% cooldown on first Main Gun volley.

- Desc: If you can't decide what to pick, pick it all.
>Packing offence debuffs for her enemies, defence buffs for her backline, a barrage that includes normal arcing shells alongside linear AP shells and even aimed torpedoes, Amagi has quite literally a bit of everything in herself; and it all comes together as one sleek and effective whole, only marginally hampered by her IJN-standard terrible AA.

* Skill: 
  * +30% Damage to self, as long as she is the only BB/BC in the fleet.
  * Every 15s, launches a cone of 4 homing torpedoes with improved tracking.

- Desc: "Slow and steady torps the race."
>One of the most consistent and hardest hitting BBs in the game, provided you cater to her social anxiety.  
Unlike many of her other similarly ranked competitors, Tirpitz isn't flashy in the slightest - no 'real' barrages to speak of, no gamechanging synergies, no ability to take other BB/BC with her - but she doesn't need to be, when hitting hard as a truck with no conditions or strings attached is something none of her rivals can claim.  
Tirpitz is, in a way, the "safe" choice - her abilities can't misfire, her HP+Armour make her tougher than anyone else, her damage buff extends to both her CL guns and torpedo spread, ensuring that even at 0 Ammo she will still be able to strike and defend herself at nigh-peak efficiency regardless.
However, all this becomes quickly irrelevant as soon as she loses her +30% damage buff as it the main reason behind her power; without it she has very little reason to be used and will be easily outshone by pretty much everyone.

- Desc: "More than just a sub". 
>Second only to Tirpitz in terms of pure staying power and armed with a quickly-proccable, backline-buffing, devastating barrage, she is exceptionally good under almost all circumstances; whether it is tearing apart mob nodes, showering enemy battleships in heavy firepower or providing support, Hood gets it done.  
Remember to have her be the flagship to make the most out of her barrage, and that the lower the cooldown on her main gun, the better.

- Desc: WAIT DON'T LEAVE JUST YET. 
>Healing on a cointoss sounds pretty bad, yes, but ask yourself this - how many units can properly heal at all, and how many of them pack the Firepower, sturdiness and self-defence capabilities of a BB?
>Yup, that's just her - and while her heal isn't as reliable as that of Unicorn or Shouhou, she's an excellent fit for a vanguard who doesn't strictly need the heals to stay alive and keep fighting.

* Skill:
  * -15% incoming aviation damage to the backline as long as North Carolina is alive and in the fleet
  * Increase FP by 30% of her total AA stat (buffs not included)

- Desc: 
>Anti-air for backliners is a bit of a meme, but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one.  
North Carolina goes harder than anyone else on the AA front, as far as backliners are concerned - not only does she prevent plane damage with her skill, she also grows stronger the more AA she acquires (and she's plenty strong to begin with, sporting a very high base FP thanks to said skill).  
Whether you do actually need all that AA is another matter entirely, but rest assured that she will lay on the hurt even if you don't - and if you do, that's just gravy.

![BB](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/95/WashingtonChibi.png "USS Washington") - **[USS Washington](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Washington)**
* Skill: 
  * 70% chance every 20s to fire a strong barrage (mid-ranged conal machinegun sweep, long range focused bombardment)
  * When South Dakota's HP falls to/below 30%, South Dakota gains Protection (avoid lethal damage for 5s) while Washington deals +20% damage and absorbs 30% of the damage sustained by South Dakota.

- Desc: "Smile for the FCR!"
>An upgunned, uparmoured and upcosted Pennsylvania with some minor synergy.  
As expensive a price tag as 15 Oil is, Washington makes up for it with a slightly better statline (AA aside, which basically doubles) and an improved barrage with some mob-clearing power - as well as a defensive synergy with South Dakota, which sees more usage in PvP than it does in PvE as it hinges on Sodak risking destruction, something you should and most likely can avoid in the first place.

* Skill:
  * 50% chance on Main Gun fire to launch a special barrage (long range: tight 4-shot wave, tight 4-shot wave with 2 shots to the sides; short range: wide V-shaped spread of small bullets)
  * 10s after battle start and every 20s, afterwards, launches a torpedo barrage (2 lines of 2 aimed torps).
  * Akagi counts her as Kaga, thus proccing her +Aviation buff.

- Desc: A sidegrade to Washington.
>Sturdier, more powerful, better armed and in possession of a much more useful synergy (Akagi still gets her +35% Aviation buff with her) in PvE, BB Kaga - affectionately called "Baga" - does however forfeit some reliability on her enhanced barrage and is stuck with an atrocious AA stat.  
She also has a few torps to throw out every now and then, but they're fairly lacklustre.

  * (Kai) On first airstrike, launch additional Zuiun.

* Desc: 
>The second most cost-effective BBs in the game, owing to their remarkable statline, Kai nodes and comparatively low Oil costs.  
Their Kai is unique in that it is a sidegrade rather than an upgrade: when turned into BBV, they trade their CL guns and 1/3 of their BB salvo for seaplanes, letting them launch airstrikes as if they were carriers.  
A steep price to pay, especially considering how weak the seaplanes are in comparison to 'proper' bombers, how slow the launches are in comparison to 'proper' carriers and how much better are Ise and Hyuuga as BBVs.

  * Every 30s, absorb 50% damage taken by main fleet for 8s, then heal for 50% of the damage taken during that time
  * 30% chance to do double damage when firing main gun

* Desc: 
>While her tanking skill isn't good enough to make her the tank she's meant to be, she is undeniably hard to kill thanks to her large HP pool and all-around excellent stats, AA included (a rarity among BB/Cs); her double damage proc needs RNG to work, but when it does it will annihilate whatever she aimed at.

* Desc: The core of most HMS fleets. 
> An unassuming figure and a merely okay statline belies one of the best buffs in the game - albeit faction-locked, and reliant on large fleets to make the most of it.

  * 60% chance upon Main Gun fire, launch a semi-aimed Sanshikidan barrage (8 shells in two waves of four, heading towards the nearest enemies); also, deal +15% damage to BB.

* Desc: 
>(PvE) Airstrike murderer extraordinaire thanks to her barrage, accomplished fireboat slayer owing to her CL guns on a BC frame, and even gets an edge against the most threatening enemies you can face later on.
A very solid defensive pick, further helped by the fact her Sanshikidan barrage doesn't need her to be in the flagship slot to do work.

* Skill:
  * +25% FP to self.
  * 20s, launch 3 unguided torpedoes in a cone.

* Desc: 
>Think Tirpitz, except not quite as hard-hitting and not as fussy about her company. She will outdamage all her BC competitors (excepting Hood and Amagi), while still being able to defend herself through a set of CL guns.  
A force to be reckoned with, especially considering her cost, but don't count on the torps to do much more than stop the occasional fireboat.

* Skill:
  * Every 15s, fires a 3-bullet (Normal, upgrades to AP after SL6) auto-critting salvo at a random target.
  * Every 20s, launch 3 unguided torpedoes in a cone.

* Desc: 
>Think Warspite, except with a functional barrage and less showboating. Between her regular guns, the CL secondaries, the automated barrage and the torps, she will throw out damage more often than any other backliner in the game.  
A force to be reckoned with, just like her sister; and just like her sister, don't count on her torps at all.

  * 20s 60% chance, fires a special barrage (4 salvo of 3 shots barraging bombarding the middle of the screen, Normal modifiers)

* Desc: 
>Often overlooked in favour of other barrage ships (eg. Hood, Washington), Pennsylvania plays it different from many others by having a timed proc instead of a main-gun-fire-based one.  
While this means you can equip whichever BB gun you'd like to stick on her, it also means that she may proc when you don't need her to and waste the barrage.  
A bit fiddly, but arguably more flexible than most and just as powerful.

- Desc: "The Queen's Royal Corgi".
>Warspite's historical achievements may be impressive, but AL does little justice to them beyond giving her the highest base FP of all BB (PR notwithstanding) and an okay statline elsewhere. What brings her down is partly her effective FP being lower than many others', but mostly her useless skill: an automated, autocritting barrage sounds great, until you realise it struggles immensely hitting anything that's not a stationary target and that the AP modifier makes it useless against the very common Light Armour in the game.  
[Also, she's a corgi.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/460645783021289472/516185017995624449/RoyalCorgi.png)

* Skill: Every 20s, 60% chance to fire a special barrage.

- Desc: "The poor man's Barrage Boat."
>A description partly in jest, and partly absolutely accurate - compared to a normal BB, they are incredibly frail (barely 3k HP with Light Armour) and considerably weaker (low FP, slightly lower Efficiency, one less salvo per volley), but they also cost a fraction than what they do and still get truly impressive barrages.  
How does this come together? As pint-sized discount-costed powerhouses for early world farming, that's how: while low, their Firepower is enough to stop fireboats in their tracks, and if given enough Evasion, they can be reliably expected to evade incoming BB salvo, prolonging their operational time much beyond what their abysmal statline would lead you to believe.  
Monitors can be expected to auto their way up to W8 or 9 with little resistance. Any further, though, and auto becomes almost impossible as enemies get more accurate, tougher and more powerful: the moment a BB opens up on them, they're already dead.

- Desc: "Newbie traps."
>So you just started playing and found these two BBs. Their barrages fire lasers everywhere and melt mobs and they look pretty tough, so they've gotta be good, right?  
Well, no, not really. It'll be like that only early on, where enemies tend to fall to a stiff breeze anyway, but the moment they're faced by serious opposition and normal (eg. 1.5k / 2k HP per trash mob) HP pools, the weaknesses of said barrage quickly come to the fore: low proc rate, proc fixed to main gun fire (which means having to take faster and weaker guns to fish for said procs), super-wide pattern subject to massive scatter and unable to hit what's directly in front of them, poor armour modifiers and poor base damage.  
In short, their barrage is the only notable feature they have - and it's both unreliable and weak.  
Avoid.

>You know what was just said about Nelson and Rodney? Well, they're even worse, courtesy of their weaker statlines and lack of CL guns; as for Maryland's +Dmg on low HP, it goes without saying that if you're taking damage, you're in an undesirable situation to begin with.  
Outgunned, outskilled, outcosted. With no hyperbole, they ARE the worst BBs in the game.

## CV/CVL ![CV(L)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/d1/CV_img.png "CV/L Icon")
### Tier 0:
---

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/dc/EnterpriseChibi.png "USS Enterprise") - [USS Enterprise](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Enterprise)
* Skill: 
  * 70% chance on airstrike launch, airstrike deals x2 damage and Enterprise becomes invincible for 8s.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>The best solo CV currently in the game, courtesy of her generally superior statline and a skill that can reliably lay the smackdown on waves and airwings alike - as well as provide some emergency damage absorption against incoming aircraft or shelling.  
It's not all bombs and sunshine, though - while her proc rate is high, she is nevertheless very reliant on that proc to perform and her generalist Efficiencies tend to blunt her effectiveness somewhat.



![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/64/AkagiChibi.png "IJN Akagi") ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/dc/KagaChibi.png "IJN Kaga") - **[IJN Akagi](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akagi)** **[IJN Kaga](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kaga)**
* Skill: 
  * First Airstrike launches 50% faster
  * When paired, increase Air Power by 35%
  * Have a 3/2/3 loadout.

- Desc: The Foxes launched first.
>Well, there they are, the poster vixens of Azur Lane. Distintctive in both looks and performance, they dwarf literally every other Carrier in the game with their massive amounts of Airpower and get to launch faster than anyone else, guaranteeing swift victories in PvP and one and a half extra airstrike per battle compared to almost any other carrier.  
As is customary for IJN sister ships, they truly shine when used together - but even when taken on their own, it cannot be understated how valuable that early launch (and extra screenclear) is.


![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/a/a1/ShouhouKaiChibi.png "IJN Shouhou Kai") - **[IJN Shouhou Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shouhou)**
* Skill: 
  * On launching an airstrike, heals the escort fleet by 8% of their HP.
  * On launching an airstrike, +15% Aviation to all CV/L for 8s.
  * Has a 0/3/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Trades Unicorn's passive frontline Reload buff for a temporary Aviation buff and a significantly superior statline, HP pool aside.  
Can't match Unicorn in air superiority, lacking fighters, but decisively asserts her dominance in raw damage output - which is what tends to matter the most, most of the time.
  
  
 ### Tier 0.5:
 ---

![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e0/RangerKaiChibi.png "USS Ranger Kai") - **[USS Ranger Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ranger)**
* Skill: 
  * 15% activation when launching an airstrike, the next airstrike becomes available immediately
  * 25% chance of inflicting double damage with airstrike
  * Has a 0/6/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Also referred to as RNGer for obvious reasons, and infamous because of her potentially infinite damage, you need luck on your side to get the most out of her; even without the procs, though, very few carriers get close to the sheer damage output she can unleash thanks to her 8 sea-attacking planes and high Efficiencies, and none of them can manage it at her rock-bottom 9 Oil cost.  
Beware her near-total lack of anti-air presence, though; without Fighters or AA guns to speak of, there's little she can do about enemy planes.

![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/e/e7/UnicornChibi.png "HMS Unicorn") - **[HMS Unicorn](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Unicorn)**
* Skill: 
  * On launching an airstrike, heals the escort fleet for 8% HP
  * Increases Reload of escort fleet by 15%
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Arguably the best pure support CVL in the game, between the heal, the reload buff and the fighter support she provides a lot of value simply by existing; and stopping her from existing is quite hard given her large HP pool, at least for the class.  
Do not expect much from her in terms of DPS, though.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/db/ShoukakuChibi.png "IJN Shoukaku") - **[IJN Shoukaku](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shoukaku)** **(T0 w/ Zuikaku)**
* Skill: 
  * On launching an airstrike, gives a fleetwide increase of damage dealt by 10% and reduces damage taken fleetwide by 10% for 12s
  * When paired, increases Air Power by 30% and INCREASES damage taken by 10%

* Loadout: 2/2/4

* Desc: 
>More support-based than her sister and frailer than she when her other half is around, but more than makes up for it thanks to the +30% Airpower she gets as well as the buffs she throws out (which incidentally also partially negate the debuff).  
Her buffs and layout are good enough to warrant usage even solo.


### Tier 1:
---
![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/dc/SaratogaKaiChibi.png "Saratoga Kai") - **[USS Saratoga Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Saratoga#retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * Every 10s, fires a 3x2-bullet HE salvo (dmg scales with Airpower).
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants +15% damage output to the vanguard for 8s.
  * Upon airstrike launch, 70% chance to deploy 3 aimed torps inflicting Ignition and Flooding from three planes.
  * Has a 2/6/0 loadout.
  
* Desc: Puella Magi Toga Magica.
>Saratoga's Kai doesn't significantly change her playstyle: she's still the powerful DB-focused CV she's always been, but with a considerably improved statline that further emphasises her strengths. Extremely solid, even from a HP standpoint.  
Her Kai skill, just like her gunfire skill, is best regarded as a bit of free additional damage than a reliable contribution to the fight - the extra planes have aimed torpedoes and the DoTs they inflict are fairly weak, but it's still better than most CV do in their downtime.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/3d/YorktownChibi.png "USS Yorktown") - **[USS Yorktown](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yorktown)**
* Skill: 
  * Once per battle, if Yorktown's HP falls below 20% she heals herself by 25%
  * Upon receiving damage and on a 20s cooldown, launches three special SBD dive bombers (x1 2000lb, x2 100lb); Upon airstrike launch, increases frontline Damage by 15% for 8s.

* Loadout: 3/3/2

- Desc: Putting the 'fleet' in 'fleet carrier'.
> One of the hardiest and most well-rounded carriers in the game, Yorktown can cover any role admirably well, courtesy of her balanced plane loadout, her frontline buff, her self-heal and her personal SBD squadron, ready to bust the heads of whoever thought she was easy pickings.
 
![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/a/a9/HiryuuChibi.png "IJN Hiryuu") - **[IJN Hiryuu](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hiryuu)** **(T0.5 w/ Souryuu)**
* Skill: 
  * Once a battle, upon taking lethal damage, will not sink and will evade all attacks for 15s, simultaneously launching an additional airstrike
  * When paired with Soryu, increases Air Power by 35%

* Loadout: 3/2/3

* Desc: 
>The stubbornest Kaga ever. Very comparable to the white kitsune in statline and efficiencies, though slightly inferior; what sets her apart from the fox is her skill, allowing her to narrowly avoid death and strike out for one last hail mary. Could win you battles both in PvE and PvP, but don't build on it.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c8/SouryuuChibi.png "IJN Souryuu") - **[IJN Souryuu](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Souryuu)** **(T0.5 w/ Hiryuu)**
* Skill: 
  * On launching an airstrike, increases escort fleet Damage by 15% for 8s
  * When paired, increases Air Power by 35%
  
* Loadout: 3/3/2

* Desc: 
>A dive bomber focused Kaga, giving up her fast launch for a frontline buff. Skills aside, what was said about Hiryuu applies to Souryuu as well.


### Tier 1.5:
---
![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/33/LexingtonChibi.png "USS Lexington") ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/fb/SaratogaChibi.png "USS Saratoga") - **[USS Lexington](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Lexington)** **[USS Saratoga](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Saratoga)**
* Skill: 
  * Every 10s, fires a 3x2-bullet HE salvo (dmg scales with Airpower).
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants +15% damage output to the vanguard for 8s.
  * Have a 2/6/0 loadout.

* Desc: 
>These two ships are identical in use (albeit not in popularity, only Saratoga has a Kai to this day), and specialize in clearing smaller enemy fleets due to their bomber focus and special salvo.  
They don't launch fast, but when they do they really leave a mark - make sure to stagger the launches as to not overwrite the Damage buff, though.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/c/c4/Ark_RoyalChibi.png "HMS Ark Royal") - **[HMS Ark Royal](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ark_Royal)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, reduce all on-screen enemies' speed by 60% and launch 3 biplanes armed with 1 aimed torpedo each.
  * 25% chance to do double damage on Airstrike.
  * Has a 0/2/6 loadout.
  
* Desc: 
>A rare Torpedo-focused CV, coming stock with two TB slots and a skill that lets her launch even more WHILE slowing any enemy on the screen.   
Whether it's boss-busting or wave-clearing, give her the appropriate planes and she'll do a pretty good job - just don't expect much of anything from her terrible DBs, and definitely do not expect your carrier-based torp to magically all hit afterwards.

#### ![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/6/62/RyuujouChibi.png "Ryuujou") - **[IJN Ryuujou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ryuujou)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, 70% chance for +15% Aviation (self) and +15% Reload (all CVL) and -15% damage received (all CV/L) for 8s
  * 5 seconds after her first two airstrikes, launches 3 additional Suisei (dropping x1 1000lb bomb, x2 100lb bombs).
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>A decent little cheerleader for the rest of your carriers, armed with a limited complement of surplus Suisei to throw out and a solid statline to supplement the smattering of buffs she throws out. Ok.

![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/53/Graf_ZeppelinChibi.png "KMS Graf Zeppelin") - **[KMS Graf Zeppelin](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Graf_Zeppelin)** **(T0 w/ other KMS units)**
* Skill: 
  * 30% increase in efficiency for equipped German planes
  * All KMS ships in fleet take 15% less damage.
  * Has a 2/6/0 loadout.

* Desc: IT'S NOT JUST A PHASE, MEIN KOMMANDANT!
>The single toughest CV in the game, courtesy of her ludicrous HP pool (6.8k), the flat damage cut she extends to every KMS unit in the fleet (herself included) and the couple of 150% ME155s she can field to keep the skies clear; and as for the offence, she's no slouch either with her remarkable six 160% Efficiency Stukas.  
Her only real flaw is her lacking Reload, a mere 100 compared to most other top-of-the-line carriers - and, of course, her lack of synergy with non-KMS units, so keep her in there and she'll do work.


### Tier 2:
---
 
#### ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/d/db/HornetChibi.png "USS Hornet") - **[BIG WASP YO (USS Hornet)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hornet)**
* Skill: 
  * 60% chance to drop 12 additional bombs with her airstrike upon launch;\
  * 25% chance to inflict double damage with her airstrike.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Once a meme, now a force to be reckoned with. Think of her as a barrage boat in carrier form - her main job is blasting ships into smithereens, and she does that remarkably well with two powerful skills dedicated precisely to that and a solid statline.  
Just don't expect much in the way of support, beyond the air coverage provided by her okay fighters.


#### ![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/92/LangleyKaiChibi.png "USS Langley") - [USS Langley Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Langley)
* Skill: 
  * Increases experience gained by CV by 15%
  * Increases Reload for CVL by 15%, does not stack with other command skills that have similar effect.
  * Has a 6/2/0 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Saddled with the much reviled F/F/B loadout and a useless (in combat) primary skill, it's hard to justify her use in most fleets - until you realise just how useful Reload is for CVL, and how cheap and effective a full CVL backline can be.  
Manual only, but the results are guaranteed; and if you need the exp boost, keep one 0LB around specifically for that purpose.

 #### ![CVL](https://i.imgur.com/te8TrVP.png "Chaser") - [HMS Chaser](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Chaser)
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, 15% chance to immediately reload it.
  * Upon airstrike launch, reveal all submarines on the screen for 10s and launch three biplanes armed with depth charges and two parallel torpedoes each.
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Chaser had a look at Ranger before leaving for the Royals and realised she was up to something good.  
With functionally 9 planes at her back and call without giving up her AA guns or high Reload, she can handily rival most other CVL in DPS while keeping some support capabilites to her credit - as well as a decent chance to throw out torrents of planes.  
That said, she's still mostly an attack craft - her ASW capabilties, while a nice touch, are entirely useless on non-ASW maps and unnecessary there, given how easily dealt with subs are.

#### ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/0/00/IllustriousChibi.png "HMS Illustrious") - **[HMS Illustrious](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Illustrious)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon airstrike launch, grants every vanguard unit a shield for 10% of Illustrious' max HP, lasting 8s.
  * Has a 6/0/2 loadout.

* Desc: 
>A very defensive-focused CV with double fighter slots and a shield generator. Her poor DPS is the stuff of legend.
Her niche is providing air superiority and protecting the frontline from harm through her shields - helpful, and while they won't replace proper healer support, they WILL help with skills proccing on damage sustained (eg. Eldridge) and keeping vanguards light on HP (eg. DDs) running for longer, especially on torpedo attack runs.

#### ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/97/ZuikakuChibi.png "IJN Zuikaku")- **[IJN Zuikaku](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Zuikaku)** **(T0 w/ Shoukaku)**
* Skill: 
  * Increases next airstrike damage by 20% on launching airstrike, stacks up to 3 times
  * When paired, increases Air Power by 20% and takes 20% less damage
  * Has a 2/3/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>An extra-tough carrier designed for prolonged fights, which basically means 'boss battles only'.  
Her skill barely contributes to most battles, and without her sister ship she's missing out a fair chunk of the stats that let her ramp up be as effective as it can be.

### Honourable Mentions:
---
#### ![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/1/16/BogueKaiChibi.png "USS Bogue Kai") - **[USS Bogue Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Bogue)**
* Skill: 
  * 15% activation when launching an airstrike, the next airstrike becomes available immediately
  * Increases AA for backline by 15%, does not stack with other command skills that have similar effect.
  * Has a 3/3/0 loadout.

* Desc: 
>Similar in concept and usage to Ranger, her airstrikes come out faster but don't provide close to the same weight of fire.  
Still, high plane efficiency coupled with a neat AA buff for the backline allows her to be decently useful and cost-effective in most situations.

#### ![CV](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/1/1b/WaspChibi.png "USS Wasp") - [USS Wasp](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Wasp)
* Skill: 
  * When deployed w/ at least 1 HMS backliner and upon airstrike launch, 50% chance to launch a Spitfire squadron.
  * Has a 3/3/2 loadout.

- Desc: SMOL WASP YO!
>The cheapest CV in the game, by virtue of her Blue rarity... and that's pretty much it, as far as remarkable features go.  
Her staline is somewhat lacklustre, her skill doesn't add much to her DPS and pushes you into using HMS backliners.  
While definitely usable, her only real use case would be plugging Hard Mode enforced ship requirements.

#### ![CVL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/f/ff/HoushouChibi.png "IJN Houshou") - [IJN Houshou](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Houshou)
* Skill: 
  * Increases experience gained by CV/L by 15%
  * +15% Aviation to all CV/L for 8s after Houshou launches an airstrike.
  * Has a 3/0/3 loadout.

* Desc: 
>The first carrier to ever sail the seas, and it shows. As THE early prototype for the ships that would later dominate the oceans, she's incredibly weak and brought further down by her mandatory CL gun - which can barely deal scratch damage, owing to her 0 Firepower statline.  
Why is this even mentioned, then? Because her +XP skill stacks with Langley's, that's why, and having her around as a 0LB exp booster may be a good idea to hasten the leveling process.

## AR ![AR](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/b/b1/AR_img.png "AR Icon")
### A few notes, and Vestal

"Repair Ship" is a misnomer for these crafts, to say the least. Here are the reasons why ---> https://pastebin.com/RucY4TwC  
TLDR; they contribute little to nothing to the fight, their healing is pathetic and vastly outclassed as soon as you use more than a single DD for your vanguard, the +1 ammo is easily negated by a single ambush (and given the inability to attack surface targets they can't assist the fleet in the battle either) and they cost the same as the much superior healer options (Unicorn / Shouhou / Arizona).  
However, **Vestal** - unlike Akashi - has a few redeeming features that make her worth taking along for lategame low(ish)-cost farming, provided you don't mind the increase in clearing times.

#### ![AR](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/3/3c/VestalChibi.png "USS Vestal") - [USS Vestal](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Vestal)
* Skill: 
  * Once per battle, Vestal heals a ship under 20% HP by 20% of the healed's HP; if the target is Enterprise, the healing amount is increased by 50%.
  * Begin each Sortie with 3 Emergency Repairs (consumable +10% fleetwide HP heals, used in the map screen). 
 
* Desc: "Vestal is Bestal".  
>"Wait, Vestal? Why not Akashi? Isn't her heal better?", you may be asking yourself - and you'd be right, Akashi's healing capacity is technically better. And it doesn't matter in the slightest.  
As covered above, Repair Ships are *terrible* healers and far outshone by cheaper/stronger/both options; competing with them is a lost cause.  
What you seek in a Repair Ship is utility, and Vestal brings a surprising amount of it to the table: be it through her rescue skill, guaranteed to save an ailing backliner's sorry arse, her stellar AA suite (two AA gun slots, each benefiting from the ARs' inbuilt +1 AGM, and three auxiliary slots you can fill with AA radars to kick her plane offence into high gear), and the usual 3 fleetwide consumable heals.  
She won't clear quick and she's obviously more suited to high-AA environments, but she *will* get the job done.
